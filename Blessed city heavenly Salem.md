# Blessed city, heavenly Salem

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Blessed city, heavenly Salem,
vision dear of peace and love,
who of living stones art builded
in the height of heaven above,
and with angel hosts encircled,
as a bride to earth dost move!

From celestial realms descending,
bridal glory round thee shed,
meet for him whose love espoused thee,
to thy Lord thou shalt be led;
all thy streets and all thy bulwarks
of pure gold are fashion√®d.

All her halls a royal priesthood
fills with music gloriously,
Praise of God from saintly voices
ringing out melodiously,
Heralding with endless joyance
God the One in persons Three.
Amen.
