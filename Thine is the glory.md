Thine is the glory,
Risen, conqu'ring Son;
Endless is the vict'ry
Thou o’er death hast won!
Angels in bright raiment
Rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes
Where thy body lay.

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conqu'ring Son;
Endless is the vict'ry
Thou o’er death hast won!

Lo, Jesus meets thee,
Risen from the tomb!
Lovingly he greets thee,
Scatters fear and gloom;
Let his Church with gladness,
Hymns of triumph sing,
For the Lord now liveth;
Death hath lost its sting!

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conqu'ring Son;
Endless is the vict'ry
Thou o’er death hast won!

No more we doubt thee,
Glorious Prince of life;
Life is nought without thee;
Aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conqu'rors,
Through thy deathless love;
Bring us safe through Jordan
To thy home above.

Thine is the glory,
Risen, conqu'ring Son;
Endless is the vict'ry
Thou o’er death hast won!
