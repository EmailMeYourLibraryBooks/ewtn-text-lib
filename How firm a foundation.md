# How firm a foundation

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 452

How firm a foundation, O saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in his excellent Word!
What more can he say than to you he has said
Who unto the Savior for refuge have fled?

Fear not! I am with you, oh, be not dismayed,
For I am your God and will still give you aid;
I’ll strengthen you, help you, and cause you to stand,
Upheld by my righteous, omnipotent hand.

When through fiery trials your pathway shall lie,
My grace all-sufficient, shall be your supply.
The flames shall not hurt you; I only design
Your dross to consume and your gold to refine.

Throughout all their lifetime my people shall prove
My sov’reign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And then, when gray hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still on my bosom be borne.
