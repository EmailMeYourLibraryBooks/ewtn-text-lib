# I know that my Redeemer liveth

***

## Setting: Handel (Messiah)

I know that my Redeemer liveth, 
and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.
And though worms destroy this body, 
yet in my flesh shall I see God.
For now is Christ risen from the dead, 
the first-fruits of them that sleep.
