# Be not afraid

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Be not afraid, for I am with you,
Be not afraid.
Be not afraid, for I am with you,
O be not afraid.
Take heart, for it is I.
Have no fear, for I am hear.
Be not afraid, 
for I am with you ever near.

Come upon the water,
Do not let your fear win out.
I will never leave you,
let go of fear and doubt.

Be not afraid, for I am with you,
Be not afraid.
Be not afraid, for I am with you,
O be not afraid.
Take heart, for it is I.
Have no fear, for I am hear.
Be not afraid, 
for I am with you ever near.

You of little faith, 
why do you doubt?
I will never leave you,
let go of fear and doubt.

Be not afraid, for I am with you,
Be not afraid.
Be not afraid, for I am with you,
O be not afraid.
Take heart, for it is I.
Have no fear, for I am hear.
Be not afraid, 
for I am with you ever near.
