# Son of a Virgin

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Son of a Virgin, 
Maker of thy Mother,
Thou Rod of Blossom 
from a stem unstained.
This virgin’s feast day 
we proclaim her glory.
Hear us, we pray Thee.

Lo, on Thy handmaid
fell a twofold blessing,
Who, in her body
conquering the weakness,
In that same body
grace from heaven obtaining,
Bore to Thee witness.

Hence, fearing neither
death nor death’s companions,
Bondage and torment
found her undefeated;
This holy maiden
shed her blood, attaining
Heavenly glory.

Fountain of mercy,
hear the prayer she offers;
Save us from error,
pardon our offenses;
So may we ever,
from a heart unsullied,
Render Thee praises.
