# O Bread of heaven, beneath this veil

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (Thaxton)

O bread of heaven, beneath this veil
Thou dost my very God conceal:
My Jesus, dearest treasure, hail;
I love thee and adoring kneel;
Each loving soul by thee is fed
With thy own self in form of bread.

O food of life, thou who dost give
The pledge of immortality;
I live; no, â€˜tis not I that live;
God gives me life, God lives in me:
He feeds my soul, he guides my ways,
And every grief with joy repays.

O bond of love, that dost unite
The servant to his living Lord;
Could I dare live, and not requite
Such love, then death were meet reward:
I cannot live unless to prove
Some love for such unmeasured love.

Beloved Lord in heaven above,
There, Jesus, thou awaitest me;
To gaze on thee with changeless love;
Yes, thus, I hope, thus shall it be:
For how can he deny me heaven
Who here on earth himself hath given?
