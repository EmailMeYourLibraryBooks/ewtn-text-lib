# Great Augustine, Holy Father

***

## Setting: ST. FLAVIAN

Great Augustine, father holy,
Listen to thy children’s cry:
Plead for us as now thou standest
Near thy maker’s throne on high
And thy prelate’s greatest glory
Guide thy flock all peacefully.

Holy poverty’s true lover,
All Christ’s poor ones Hymn thy praise;
Truth’s own champion and defender
Loved by all who seek her ways
Scripture’s wealth of heavenly teaching
All her gems thy pen displays.
