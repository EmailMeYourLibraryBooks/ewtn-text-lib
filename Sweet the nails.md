# Sweet the nails

***

## Setting: Pius X Hymnal 211

Over the earth itâ€™s arms extending
Let us sing the Holy Rood,
Scarce beneath its Burden bending
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood.

With a dim interpretation,
By the prophets understood,
Sang the trees of all creation,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood.

Table of the holy Nation,
Where was spread the mystic Food,
For its transubstantiation,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood.

Altar where was consummated
Sacrifice of Flesh and Blood,
With a newer rite created,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood,
Sweet the nails and sweet the wood.
