# Make songs off joy to Christ, our head

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 150

Make songs of joy to Christ, our head; Alleluia!
He lives again who once was dead! Alleluia!

Our life was purchased by his loss; Alleluia!
He died our death upon the cross. Alleluia!

O death, where is your deadly sting? Alleluia!
Assumed by our triumphant King! Alleluia!

And where your victory, O grave, Alleluia!
When one like Christ has come to save? Alleluia!

Behold, the tyrants, one and all, Alleluia!
Before our mighty Savior fall! Alleluia!

For this be praised the Son who rose, Alleluia!
The Father, and the Holy Ghost! Alleluia!
