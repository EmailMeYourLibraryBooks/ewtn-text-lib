Come, brethren, follow, where our captain
trod,
Our King victorious, Christ the Son of God.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

Led on their way by this triumphant sign,
The hosts of God in conquering ranks
combine.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

Each newborn soldier of the Crucified
Bears on his brow the seal of him who died.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

This is the sign which Satan’s legions fear
And angels veil their faces to revere.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

Saved by this cross whereon their Lord was
slain,
The sons of Adam their lost home regain.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

From north and south, from east and west
they raise
In growing unison their songs of praise.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ

name.

O Lord, once lifted on the glorious Tree,
As thou hast promised, draw men unto
thee.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

Let every race and every language tell
Of him who saves our souls from death and
hell.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

From farthest regions let them homage
bring,
And on his cross adore their Savior King.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

Set up thy throne, that earth’s despair may
cease
Beneath the shadow of its healing peace.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.

For thy blest cross which doth for all atone
Creation’s praises rise before thy throne.

Lift high the cross, the love of Christ
proclaim till all the world adore his sacred
name.
