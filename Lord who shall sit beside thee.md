# Lord, who shall sit beside thee

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (Thaxton)

Lord, who shall sit beside thee,
Enthroned on either hand,
When clouds no longer hide thee,
'Mid all thy faithful band?

Who drinks the cup of sorrow
Thy Father gave to thee
'Neath shadows of the morrow
In dark Gethsemane;

Who on thy Passion thinking
Can find in loss a gain,
And dare to meet unshrinking
Thy baptism of pain.

O Jesu, form within us
Thy likeness clear and true;
By thine example win us
To suffer and to do.

This law itself fulfilleth,--
Christlike to Christ is nigh,
And, where the Father willeth,
Shall sit with Christ on high.
