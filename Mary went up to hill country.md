# Mary went up to hill country

***

## Setting: Carl Schalk

Mary went up to hill country,
Elizabeth she came to see.
Her cousin’s greeting which she heard
Came by the Spirit’s inward word:
“You are the mother of my King.”
Then sweetly did the virgin sing:

My heart God’s greatness voices,
My soul in him rejoices.
He is my Savior, faithful, true;
His mercy will enfold you too.

Stay-at-homes never let us be,
But go we up through hill country.
And there speak kindly, each to each,
The Spirit’s greeting that can reach
The heart and open it to sing
The song that only faith can bring:

My heart God’s greatness voices,
My soul in him rejoices.
He is my Savior, faithful, true;
His mercy will enfold you too.
