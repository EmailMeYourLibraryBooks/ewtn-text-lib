# Come with us, O blessed Jesus

***

## Setting: The Hymnal 1982 336

Come with us, O blessed Jesus,
With us evermore to be;
And though leaving now thine altar,
Let us nevermore leave thee.
Be thou one with us forever,
In our live thy love divine
Our own flesh and blood has taken,
And to us thou givest thine.

Come with us, O mighty Savior,
God from God, and Light from Light;
Thou art God, thy glory veiling,
So that we may bear the sight.
Now we go to seek and serve thee,
Through our work and through our prayer;
Grant us light to see and know thee,
In thy people everywhere.

Come with us, O King of glory,
By angelic voices praised;
In our hearts as in thy heaven,
Be enraptured anthems raised.
Let the mighty chorus ever
Sing it’s glad exultant songs;
Let it’s hymn be heard for ever—
Peace for which creation longs.
