# Keep we the fast that men of old

## Setting: Hymn sheet (WAREHAM)

Keep we the fast that men of old
Learned from on high in mystic ways.
Till yonder sun hath duly told
His hallowed tale of forty days.

This covenant long since revealed
To patriarchs and ardent seers
Christ by his own example sealed,
Author of time, and Lord of years.

More wisely therefore let us walk,
Sparing of food and wine and sleep;
Over our trifles and our talk
More jealous be the watch we keep.

Still by our sins, O Lord,
We grieve thy love, So full of pardon free:
Author of mercy, still reprieve
The souls that turn again to thee.

Hear us, O Trinity sublime
And undivided Unity;
So leet this consecrated time
Bring forth thy fruits abundantly.
