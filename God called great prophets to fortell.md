# God called great prophets to foretell

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn supplement

God called great prophets to foretell
The coming of His Son;
The greatest, called before His birth,
Was John, the chosen one.

John searched in solitude for Christ
And knew Him when He came.
He showed the world the Lamb of God
And hailed Him in our name.

That lonely voice cried out the truth,
Derided and denied.
As witness to the law of God
His mighty martyr died.
