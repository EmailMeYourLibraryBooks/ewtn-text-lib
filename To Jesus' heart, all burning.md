# To Jesus' heart, all burning

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (LANCASHIRE)

To Jesus’ Heart, all burning,
With fervent love for men,
My heart with fondest yearning
Shall raise its joyful strain.
While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By every heart and tongue.
 
O Heart, for me on fire
With love no man can speak,
My yet untold desire
God gives me for thy sake.
While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By every heart and tongue.
 
As thou art meek and lowly,
And ever pure of heart,
So may my heart be wholly
Of thine the counterpart.
While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By every heart and tongue.
 
When life away is flying,
And earth’s false glare is done;
Still, Sacred Heart, in dying
I’ll say I’m all thine own.
While ages course along,
Blest be with loudest song
The Sacred Heart of Jesus
By every heart and tongue.
