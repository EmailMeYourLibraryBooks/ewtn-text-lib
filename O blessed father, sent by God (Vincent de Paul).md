# O blessed father, sent by God (Vincent de Paul)

***

## Setting: Saint Gregory Hymnal 108

O blessed Father, sent by God
His mercy to dispense,
Thy hand is out o’er all the earth, 
Like God’s own providence.
There is no grief nor care of men,
Thou dost not own for thine,
No broken heart thou dost not fill
With mercy’s oil and wine.

Thy miracles are works of love;
Thy greatest is to make
Room in a day for toil that weeks
In other men would take.
All cries of suffering through the earth
Upon thy mercy call,
As though thou wert, like God Himself,
A Father unto all.

Dear Saint not in the wilderness
Thy fragrant virtues bloo,,
But in the city’s crowded haunts,
The alley’s cheerless gloom.
When hunger hid itself to die,
Where guiltin darkness dwelt
Thy pleasant sunshine came by stealth
Thy hand and heart were felt.

For charity anointed thee
O’er want and woe, and pain;
And she hath crowned thee emporor
Of all her wide domain.
Vincent! like Mother mary thou
Art no one’s patron saint.
Eyes to the blind, health to the sick,
And life to those who faint.
