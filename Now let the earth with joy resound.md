# Now let the earth with joy resound

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Now let the earth with joy resound,
And heaven the chant re-echo ‘round;
Nor heaven nor earth too high can raise
The great Apostle’s glorious praise

O ye who, throned in glory dread,
Shall judge the living and the dead.
Lights of the world forevermore!
To you the suppliant prayer we pour.

So when the world is at its end,
And Christ to Judgment shall descend,
May we be called those joys to see
Prepared from all eternity.
