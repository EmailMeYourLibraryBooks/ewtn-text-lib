# Lord Jesus, once you spoke to men

***

## Setting: Thaxton (O JESU, MI DULCISSIME)

Lord Jesus, once you spoke to men
Upon the mountain, in the plain;
O help us listen now, as then,
And wonder at your words again.

We all have secret fears to face,
Our minds and motives to amend;
We seek your truth, we need your grace,
Our living Lord and present Friend.

The Gospel speaks, and we receive
Your light, your love, your own command,
O help us live what we believe
In daily work of hearts and hand.
