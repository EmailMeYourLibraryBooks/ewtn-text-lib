# Mary immaculate, star of the morning

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (LIEBSTER EMMANUEL)

Mary Immaculate, star of the morning,
Chosen before the creation began,
Chosen to bring, for thy bridal adorning,
Woe to the serpent and rescue to man.

Here, in an orbit of shadows and sadness
Veiling thy splendour, thy course thou hast run;
Now thou art throned in all glory and gladness;
Crowned by the hand of thy Saviour and Son.

Sinners, we worship thy sinless perfection;
Fallen and weak, for thy pity we plead;
Grant us the shield of thy sovereign protection,
Measure thine aid by the depth of our need.

Bend from thy throne at the voice of our crying,
Bend to this earth which thy footsteps have trod;
Stretch out thine arms to us living and dying,
Mary Immaculate, Mother of God.
