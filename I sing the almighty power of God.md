# I sing th'almighty power of God

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 616

I sing the mighty power of God
that made the mountains rise,
that spread the flowing seas abroad,
and built the lofty skies.
I sing the wisdom that ordained
the sun to rule the day;
the moon shines full at his command
and all the stars obey.

I sing the goodness of the Lord
that filled the earth with food;
he formed the creatures with his word,
and then pronouneced them good.
Lord, how thy wonders are displayed
where’er I turn my eye;
if I survey the ground I tread,
or gaze upon the sky!

There’s not a plant or flower below
byt makes thy glories known;
and clouds arise, and tempests blow,
by order from thy throne;
while all that borrows life from thee
is ever in thy care,
and everywhere that man can be,
thou, God, art present there.
