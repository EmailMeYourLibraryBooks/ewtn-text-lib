# Creator of the Stars of Night

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 309

Creator of the stars of night,
Thy peopleâ€™s everlasting light,
O Jesus, Savior of us all,
Regard thy servants when they call.

Thou, grieving at the bitter cry,
Of all creation doomed to die,
Didst come to save a ruined race
With healing gifts of heavenly grace.

Thou camest, Bridegroom of the bride,
As drew the world to evening tide,
Proceeding from a virgin shrine,
The Son of Man, yet Lord divine.

At thy great name, exalted now,
All knees must bend, all hearts must bow,
And things in heaven and earth shall own
That thou art Lord and King alone.

To thee, O Holy One, we pray,
Our judge in that tremendous day,
Preserve us, while we dwell below,
From every onslaught of the foe.

All praise, eternal Son, to thee,
Whose advent sets thy people free,
Whom with the Father we adore,
And Spirit blest, for evermore.
