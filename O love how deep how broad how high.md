# O love, how deep, how broad, how high

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

O love how deep, how broad, how high!
it fills the heart with ecstasy
that God, the Son of God, should take
our mortal form for mortalsâ€™ sake.

For us he was baptized, and bore
his holy fast, and hungered sore;
for us temptations sharp he knew;
for us the tempter overthrew.

For us he prayed, for us he taught,
for us his daily works he wrought,
by words and signs and actions, thus
still seeking not himself but us.

For us to wicked hands betrayed,
scourged, mocked, in purple robe arrayed,
he bore the shameful cross and death;
for us at length gave up his breath.
Eternal glory to our God
for love so deep, so high, so broad,
the Trinity whom we adore
forever and forevermore.
