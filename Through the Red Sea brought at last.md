# Through the Red Sea brought at last

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Through the Red Sea brought at last, alleluia!
Egypt's chains behind we cast, alleluia!
Deep and wide flows the tide
severing us from bondage past, alleluia!

Like the cloud that overhead, alleluia!
through the billows Israel led, alleluia!
By his tomb Christ makes room,
souls restoring from the dead, alleluia!

In that cloud and in that sea, alleluia!
Buried and baptized were we, alleluia!
Earthly night brought us light,
which is ours eternally, alleluia!
