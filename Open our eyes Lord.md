# Open our eyes, Lord

***

## Setting: Deborah Garcia

Open my eyes, Lord,
I want to see Jesus,
To reach out and touch him,
And tell him I love him.

Open our ears, Lord,
and help us to listen,
Open our eyes, Lord,
We want to see Jesus!

Open our eyes, Lord,
We want to see Jesus.
To reach out and touch him,
and tell him we love him.

Open our ears, Lord,
and help us to listen,
Open our eyes, Lord,
we want to see Jesus.

Open our eyes, Lord,
we want to see Jesus!
