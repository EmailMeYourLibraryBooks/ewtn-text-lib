# Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days

***

## Setting: United Methodist Hymnal 708

Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days;
a world without saints forgets how to praise.
Their faith in acquiring the habit of prayer,
their depth of adoring, Lord, help us to share.

Some march with events to turn them God's way;
some need to withdraw, the better to pray;
some carry the gospel through fire and through flood:
our world is their parish; their purpose is God.

Rejoice in those saints, unpraised and unknown,
who bear someone's cross or shoulder their own;
they shame our complaining, our comforts, our cares:
what patience in caring, what courage, is theirs!

Rejoice in God's saints, today and all days;
a world without saints forgets how to praise.
In loving, in living, they prove it is true:
the way of self giving, Lord, leads us to you.
