# Most ancient of all mysteries

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 617

Most ancient of all mysteries,
Before your throne we lie;
Have mercy now, most merciful,
Most holy Trinity.

When heaven and earth were still unmade,
When time was yet unknown,
You in your radiant majesty 
Did live and love alone.

You were not born, there was no source
From which your Being flowed;
There is no end which you can reach,
For you are simply God.

How wonderful creation is,
The work which you did bless,
What then must you be like, dear God,
Eternal loveliness!

Most ancient of all mysteries,
Before your throne we lie;
Have mercy now and evermore,
Most holy Trinity. Amen.
