# Jerusalem, my happy home

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Jerusalem, my happy home,
when shall I come to thee?
When will my sorrows have an end?
Thy joys, when shall I see?

O happy harbor of the saints,
O sweet and pleasant soil!
In thee no sorrow may be found,
no grief, no care, no toil.

Thy saints are crowned with glory great;
they see God face to face;
they triumph still, they still rejoice;
most happy is their case.

Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
God grant that I may see
thine endless joy, and of the same
partaker ever be!
