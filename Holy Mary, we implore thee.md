# Holy Mary, we implore thee

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (HYFRYDOL)

Holy Mary, we implore thee,
By thy purity divine;
Help us, bending here before thee,
Help us truly to be thine.
Thou, unfolding wide the portals
Of the kingdom in the skies,
Holy Virgin, hast to mortals
Shown the land of Paradise.

Thou when deepest night infernal
Had for ages shrouded man,
Gavest us that Light eternal
Promised since the world began.
God in thee hath showered plenty
On the hungry and the weak;
Sending back the mighty empty,
Setting up on high the meek.

Teach, oh teach us, holy Mother,
How to conquer every sin,
How to love and help each other,
How the prize of life to win.
Thou to whom a child was given,
Greater than the sons of men,
Coming down from highest heaven,
To create this world again.

Oh, by that Almighty Maker,
Whom thyself a Virgin bore;
Oh, by thy supreme Creator,
Linked with thee for evermore;
By the hope thy name inspires,
By our doom reversed through thee:
Help us, Queen of angel choirs,
Now and through eternity.
