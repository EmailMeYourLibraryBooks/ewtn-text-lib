# Sounds of joy have put to flight

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 536

Sounds of joy have put to flight
All the sadness of the night;
Now a maid beyond compare
Hears her praises fill the air:
Virgo Maria.

Who is she whom angels sing,
Making all creation ring?
She it is who wins our praise,
As on earth our voice we raise:
Virgo Maria.

Queen of virgins, Maiden mild,
Hear me, take me for your child,
Ever my protector be,
Bring eternal life to me:
Virgo Maria.

Mighty Godhead, Three-in-One,
While eternal ages run,
Look to Mary, full of Grace,
And forgive the human race:
Virgo Maria.
