# O Word, that goest forth on high

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 305

O Word, that goest forth on high
From Godâ€™s own depths eternally,
And in these latter days wast born
For succor to a world forlorn;

Pour light upon us from above,
And fire our hearts with ardent love,
That, as we hear thy truth today,
All wrong desires may burn away;

And when, as judge, thou drawest nigh
The secrets of our hearts to tru,
To recompense each hidden sin
And bid the saints their reign begin;

O let us not, weak sinful men,
Be driven from thy presence then,
But with thy saints for ever stand
In perfect love at thy right hand.

To God the Father, God the Son,
And God the Spirit, ever one,
Praise, honor, might and glory be 
From age to age eternally.
