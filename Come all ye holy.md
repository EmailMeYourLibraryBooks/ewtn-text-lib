# Come, all ye holy (Sancti Venite)

***

## Setting: Saint Jean Brébreuf Hymnal 464

Come, all ye holy,
take the body of your Lord,
Drink of his Chalice,
take the blood for you outpoured.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Saved by his body,
by his sacred blood, we raise
Grateful our voices
unto God in hymns of praise.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Christ our salvation,
he who is the Son of God,
Purchased our ransom
By his cross and precious blood.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Dying for all men,
he the Lord prepared the feast,
Offered as victim,
offering himself as priest.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

God to our father’s
ordered sacrifice of old;
So he in symbols
Christ the victim true fortold.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Source of all brightness,
sole Redeemer of our race,
He to his holy
servants gives abundant grace.
Kyrie eleison.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.

Come, all ye holy, 
take the body of your Lord,
Drink of his Chalice,
take the blood for you outpoured.

Saved by his body,
by his sacred blood, we raise
Grateful our voices
unto God in hymns of praise.

Giver of life, he,
Christ our Savior, Son of God,
Brought our redemption
by his Cross and precious blood.

Dying for all men, 
he the Lord prepared the feast,
Offered as victim,
offering himself as priest.

God to our fathers
ordered sacrifice of old;
So he in symbols
Christ the victim true foretold.

Giver of light,
the one Redeemer of our race,
He to his holy
servants gives abundant grace.

Come, who with pure hearts
in the Savior’s word believe
Come and partaking
saving grace from him receive.

God, our defender
guardian sure in this our strife,
gives to his faithful
after death eternal life,

He to the hungry
gives as food this heavenly bread,
Fountain of life, he 
gives to drink the blood he shed

Christ, source of all things,
who here feeds us sinful men,
When his great day dawns,
judge of all will come again.
