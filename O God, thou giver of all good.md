# O God, thou giver of all good

## Setting: Hymn sheet (PUER NOBIS NASCITUR)

O God, thou giver of all good,
Thy children live by daily food;
And daily must the prayer be said,
“Give us this day our daily bread.”

The life of earth and seed is thine; 
Suns glow, rains fall, by power divine;
Thou art in all; not e’en the powers
By which we toil for bread are ours.

What large provision thou hast made!
As large as is thy children’s need;
How wide the bounteous love is spread!
Wide as the want of daily bread.

Since every day by thee we live,
May grateful hearts thy gifts receive;
And may the hands be pure from stain
With which our daily bread we gain.
