# I heard the voice of Jesus say

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 579

I heard the voice of Jesus say
“Come unto me and rest;
lay down, thou weary one, lay down
thy head upon my breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was
weary and worn and sad:
I found in him a resting place,
and he has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say
“Behold, I freely give
the living water; thirsty one,
stoop down, and drink, and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
of that lifegiving stream;
my thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
and now I live in him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say
“I am this dark world’s light;
look unto me, thy morn shall rise,
and all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
in him my star, my sun;
and in that light of life I’ll walk
till travelling days are done.
