# 'Tis good, Lord, to be here

***

## Setting: Gather Comprehensive 771

‘Tis good, Lord, to be here!
Your glory fills the night;
Your face and garments like the sun,
Shine with unborrowed light.

‘Tis good, Lord, to be here,
Your beauty to behold,
Where Moses and Elijah stand,
Your messengers of old.

Fulfiller of the past!
Promise of things to be!
We hail your body glorified,
and our redemption see.

Be fore we taste of death,
We see your kingdom come;
We long to hold the vision bright,
And make this hill our home.

‘Tis good, Lord, to be here!
Yet we may not remain;
But since you bid us leave the mount,
Come with us to the plain.
