# Glory be to Jesus

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 95

Glory be to Jesus,
Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for me the lifeblood
From his sacred veins.

Grace and life eternal
In that blood I find;
Blest be his compassion,
Infinitely kind.

Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream
Which from endless torment
Did the world redeem.

Abel’s blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.

Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.

Lift we then our voices,
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood.

Glory be to Jesus,
Who, in bitter pains,
Poured for us the lifeblood
From his sacred veins.
Grace and life eternal
In that blood we find;
Blest be his compassion,
Infinitely kind.

Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream
Jesus, by his mercy,
Doth  the world redeem.
Sing with joy, ye nations; 
All your voices raise:
Jesus’ Blood has saved us,
Kneel and give him praise.
