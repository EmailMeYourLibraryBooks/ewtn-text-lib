# The Master came to bring good news

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

The Master came to bring good news, 
The news of love and freedom,
To heal the sick and seek the poor,
To build the peaceful kingdom.
Father, forgive us! Through Jesus hear us!
As we forgive one another!

The Lawâ€™s fulfilled through Jesus Christ,
The man who lived for others.
The law of Christ is: Serve in love
Our sisters and our brothers.
Father, forgive us! Through Jesus hear us!
As we forgive one another!

To seek the sinners Jesus came,
To live among the friendless,
To show them love that they might share
The kingdom that is endless.
Father, forgive us! Through Jesus hear us!
As we forgive one another!

Forgive us, Lord, as we forgive
And seek to help each other.
Forgive us, Lord, and we shall live
To pray and work together.
Father, forgive us! Through Jesus hear us!
As we forgive one another!
