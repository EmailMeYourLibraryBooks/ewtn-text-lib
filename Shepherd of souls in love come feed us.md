# Shepherd of souls, in love, come feed us

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (Thaxton)

Shepherd of souls, in love come, feed us,
Life-giving Bread for hungry hearts!
To those refreshing waters lead us
Where dwells that grace your peace imparts.
May we, the wayward in your fold,
By your forgiveness rest consoled.

Sinful is man who stands before you,
Worthy of you are you alone;
Yet in your name do we implore you,
Rich are your mercies you have shown.
Say but the word, O Lord divine,
Then are our hearts made pure like thine.

Father who fed the Hebrew nation,
Giving them manna from the sky,
Give now the bread of our salvation,
That we who eat shall never die.
We are your people, God, in need;
May we on living bread now feed.

Help us dear Lord, prepare a dwelling
Worthy of you who made us all;
Cleanse now our hearts, our guilt dispelling,
Purigy us who heed your call.
“Take this and eat” were words you said;
So we have gathered for this bread.
