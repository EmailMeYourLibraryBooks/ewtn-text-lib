# Baited, the question rose

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Baited, the question rose
From somewhere in the crowd:
“Teacher, you truly know God’s way;
Is paying tax allowed?”
Jesus perceived their trap:
“Why do you test me so?”
Bring here the coin the tax requires, 
And see what it will show.

“Whose image does it bear;
Whose names and titles tell?”
“Caesar’s, of course,” they smugly said
And thought they answered well.
“Give Caesar what is his;
Give God what is God’s alone.”
Strong words, convincing and profound,
Like truth already known.

May we discern, O God,
Your daily gifts of grace;
Show us your image freshly coined
In every heart and face.
Help us fit tribute yield
Through prayers and hymns we raise,
But most of all by deeds of love
To give you thanks and praise.
