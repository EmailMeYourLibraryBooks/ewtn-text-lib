## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 415

Christ the Lord is risen today, Alleluia!
Earth and heaven in chorus say, Alleluia!
Raise your joys and triumphs high, Alleluia!
Sing, ye heavens, and earth reply, Alleluia!

Lives again our glorious King, Alleluia!
Where, O death, is now thy sting? Alleluia!
Once he died our souls to save, Alleluia!
Where's thy victory, O grave? Alleluia!

Love's redeeming work is done, Alleluia!
Fought the fight, the battle won, Alleluia!
Death in vain forbids him rise, Alleluia!
Christ has opened paradise, Alleluia!

Soar we now where Christ has led, Alleluia!
Following our exalted Head, Alleluia!
Made like him, like him we rise, Alleluia!
Ours the cross, the grave, the skies, Alleluia!

 "Christ the Lord is ris'n today!"
All on earth with angels say;
Raise your joys and triumphs high;
Sing, ye heav'ns; and earth, reply.

Love's redeeming work is done,
Fought the fight, the battle won;
Lo! The sun's eclipse is o'er.
Lo! He sets in blood no more.

Vain the stone, the watch, the seal;
Christ has burst the gates of hell.
Death in vain forbids his rise;
Christ has opened paradise.

Lives again our glorious king!
Where, O death, is now thy sting?
Once he died our souls to save;
Where thy victory, O grave?

Hail the Lord of earth and heav'n!
Praise to thee by both be giv'n.
Thee we greet triumphant now;
Hail, the resurrection, thou!

King of glory, soul of bliss,
Everlasting life is this:
Thee to know, thy pow'r to prove,
Thus to sing, and thus to love!
