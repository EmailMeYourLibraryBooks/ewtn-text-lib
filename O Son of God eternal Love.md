# O Son of God, eternal Love

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

O Son of God, eternal Love,
Who came in mercy from above
To bring to men the Fatherâ€™s grace,
And sanctify a ransomed race.

Illumine every Christian mind,
And grant us through your Word to find
The truth that sets the bondsman free,
The service that is liberty.

To Christ whose blood for us was shed,
Who rose victorious from the dead,
Whose glory all the saints adore,
Be endless praise for evermore.
