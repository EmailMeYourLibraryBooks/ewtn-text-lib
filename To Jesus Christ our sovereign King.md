To Jesus Christ, our sovereign King,
Who is the world's salvation,
All praise and homage do we bring
And thanks and adoration.
Christ Jesus, Victor!
Christ Jesus, Ruler!
Christ Jesus, Lord and Redeemer!

Thy reign extend, O King benign,
To every land and nation,
For in thy kingdom, Lord divine,
Alone we find salvation.
Christ Jesus, Victor!
Christ Jesus, Ruler!
Christ Jesus, Lord and Redeemer!

To thee and to thy Church, great King,
We pledge our hearts' oblation,
Until before thy throne we sing
In endless jubilation.
Christ Jesus, Victor!
Christ Jesus, Ruler!
Christ Jesus, Lord and Redeemer!

Thy majesty shall be the praise
And thanks of every nation;
To thee the world with joy shall raise
The voice of exultation.
Christ Jesus, Victor!
Christ Jesus, Ruler!
Christ Jesus, Lord and Redeemer!
