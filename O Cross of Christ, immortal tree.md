# O Cross of Christ, immortal tree

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 361

O Cross of Christ, immortal tree
On which our Savior died,
The world is sheltered by your arms
That bore the Crucified.
 
From bitter death and barren wood
The tree of life is made;
Its branches bear unfailing fruit
And leaves that never fade.
 
O faithful Cross, you stand unmoved
While ages run their course;
Foundation of the universe,
Creation’s binding force.
 
Give glory to the risen Christ
And to his cross give praise,
The sign of God’s unfathomed love,
The hope of all our days.
