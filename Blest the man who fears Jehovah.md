# Blest the man who fears Jehovah

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet

Blest the man who fears Jehovah,
Walking ever in his ways;
By your toil you shall be prospered
And be happy all your days,
Lo, on him who fears Jehovah
Shall this blessedness attend,
For Jehovah out of Zion
Shall to you his blessing send.

Joyful children, sons and daughters,
Shall about your table meet,
Olive plants, in strength and beauty,
Full of hope and promise sweet.
You shall see God’s kingdom prosper
All your days, till life shall cease,
You shall see your children’s children;
On your people, Lord, be peace!
