# Go to the world! Go into all the earth

***

## Setting: Thaxton (SINE NOMINE)

Go to the world! Go into all the earth.
Go preach the cross where Christ renews life’s worth.
Baptizing as the sign of our rebirth.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Go to the world! Go into every place.
Go live the Word of God’s redeeming grace.
Go seek God’s presence in each time and space.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Go to the world! Go struggle, bless and pray.
The nights of tears give way to joyous day.
As servant Church you follow Christ’s own way.
Alleluia! Alleluia!

Go to the world! Go as the ones I send,
For I am with you till the age shall end,
When all the hosts of glory cry “Amen!”
Alleluia! Alleluia!
