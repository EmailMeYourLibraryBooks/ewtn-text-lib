# Dear heart of Jesus, source of love and mercy

***

## Setting: Singenberger, arr. Banks

Dear heart of Jesus, source of love and mercy!
We beg of Thee, O fount of living grace!
O, list to souls who humbly now implore thee,
And make them Thine forever, ever more.

Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
O, make our hearts all Thine!
O, make our hearts all Thine!

Would that our hearts responding to Thy longings
Were pure and simple, loving none but Thee,
E’er self-forgetting, patient, meek, and humble,
And loving Thee with pure seraphic love.

Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
O, make our hearts all Thine!
O, make our hearts all Thine!

Sweet heart of Jesus, O, how much it grieves us,
To see Thy love so often unrepaid,
To hear Thee scorned, derided and rejected
By those for whom thy loveing heart e’er yearns.

Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
Dear heart of Jesus, so humble and so mild,
O, make our hearts all Thine!
O, make our hearts all Thine!
