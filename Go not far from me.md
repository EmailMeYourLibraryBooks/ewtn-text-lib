# Go not far from me

***

## Setting: Zingarelli (abridged)

Go not far from me, far from me, O God;
Cast me not away, cast me not away
in the time of age.
Cast me not away in the time of age;
Forsake me not, forsake me not,
forsake me not when my strength faileth me.

O let my mouth be filled with thy praise,
be filled with thy praise that I may sing,
That I may sing, that I may sing,
that I may sing thy glory and honor
all the day long, all the day long
That I may sing, that I may sing,
that I may sing thy glory and honor
all the day long, all the day long.
That I may sing of thy glory all the day long
That I may sing of thy glory all the day long
all the day long
all the day long.
