# O Salt of the earth, ye virtuous few

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

O Salt of the earth, ye virtuous few,
Who season humankind!
O Light of the world, whose cheering ray
Illumines the realms of mind!
Where misery spreads her deepest shade,
Your strong compassion glows;
From your blest lips the balm distills
that softens mortal woes.

You lift on high the warning voice,
When public ills prevail;
Yours is the writing on the wall
That turns the tyrant pale.
Proceed, your race of glory run;
Your virtuous toils endure;
You come commissioned from on high,
And your reward is sure.
