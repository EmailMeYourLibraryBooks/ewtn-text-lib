# Lamp of our feet, whereby we trace

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (ST. AGNES)

Lamp of our feet, whereby we trace
Our path when wont to stray,
Stream from the fount of heavenly grace,
Brook by the travellerâ€™s way;

Bread of our souls, whereon we feed,
True manna from on high,
Our guide and chart, wherein we read
Of realms beyond the sky;

Pillar of fire through watches dark,
And radiant cloud by day,
When waves would whelm our tossing bark,
Our anchor and our sky;

Word of the everliving God,
Will of his glorious Son,
Without thee how could earth be trod,
Or heaven itself be won?

Lord, grant that we aright may learn
The wisdom it imparts,
And to its heavenly teaching turn
With simple, childlike hearts.
