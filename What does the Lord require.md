# What does the Lord require

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

What does the Lord require for praise and offering?
What sacrifice, desire, or tribute bid you bring?
Do justly; love mercy; walk humbly with your God.

Rulers of men, give ear! Should you not justice know?
Will God your pleading hear, while crime and cruelty grow?
Do justly; love mercy; walk humbly with your God.

Masters of wealth and trade, all you for whom men toil,
Think not to win God’s aid, if lies your commerce soil.
Do justly; love mercy; walk humbly with your God.

Still down the ages ring the prophet’s stern commands:
To merchant, worker, king, he brings God’s high demands:
Do justly; love mercy; walk humbly with your God.

How shall our life fulfill God’s law so hard and high?
Let Christ endue our will with grace to fortify.
Then justly, in mercy; we’ll humbly walk with God.
