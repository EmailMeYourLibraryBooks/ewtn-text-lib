## Setting: Hymn sheet (CHRISTE SANCTORUM, vv. 2,3,4)

Send thine archangel
Michael to our succor;
Peacemaker blessed,
May he banish from us
Striving and hatred, 
So that for the peaceful
All things may prosper.

Send thine archangel
Gabriel, the mighty;
Herald of heaven,
May he, from us mortals,
Drive every evil,
Watching oâ€™er the temples
Where thou art worshipped.

Send from the heavens
Raphael archangel,
Health-bringer blessed,
Aiding every sufferer,
That, in thy service,
He may wisely guide us,
Healing and blessing.
