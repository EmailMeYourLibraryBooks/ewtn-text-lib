# God of mercy and compassion

***

## Setting: N.A.M.

God of mercy and compassion,
Look with pity upon me.
Father, let me call Thee Father,
’Tis Thy child returns to Thee.

Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;
Let me not implore in vain;
All my sins—I now detest them,
Never will I sin again.

By my sins I have abandoned
Right and claim to Heav’n above,
Where the saints rejoice forever,
In a boundless sea of love.

Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;
Let me not implore in vain;
All my sins—I now detest them,
Never will I sin again.

See our Savior, bleeding, dying,
On the cross of Calvary;
To that cross my sins have nailed Him,
Yet He bleeds and dies for me.

Jesus, Lord, I ask for mercy;
Let me not implore in vain;
All my sins—I now detest them,
Never will I sin again.
