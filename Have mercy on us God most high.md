# Have mercy on us, God most high

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Have mercy on us, God Most High,
who lift our hearts to thee;
have mercy now, most merciful,
most holy Trinity.
When heaven and earth were yet unmade,
when time was yet unknown,
thou in thy bliss and majesty
didst live and love alone.

How wonderful creation is,
the work which thou didst bless;
and, O what then must thou be like,
eternal loveliness!
Most ancient of all mysteries!
Low at thy throne we lie:
have mercy now, most merciful,
most holy Trinity.
