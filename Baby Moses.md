# Baby Moses

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Who will take little baby?
“I,” said the water deep.
“Baby will float in his cradle boat
And I shall rock him to sleep.”

Who will hide little baby?
“We,” said the rushes tall.
“Safely we’ll hide Baby Moses inside,
That nobody sees him at all.”
Who will watch over the baby?
Miriam whispers, “I.”
“I’m sure to hear if the baby dear
Gives even a tiny, soft cry.”

Who will guard little baby?
Out of the waters blue?
Silently sleep, Moses, safely sleep,
For God will take care of you.
