# Good Christians all, rejoice and sing

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 419

Good Christian men, rejoice and sing!
Now is the triumph of our King:
To all the world glad news we bring:
Alleluia!

The Lord of Life is risen for ay:
Bring flowers of song to strew his way;
Let all mankind rejoice and say:
Alleluia!

Praise we in songs of victory
That Love, that Life, which cannot die,
And sing with hearts uplifted high:
Alleluia!

Thy name we bless, O risen Lord,
And sing today with one accord
The life laid down, the life restored:
Alleluia!
