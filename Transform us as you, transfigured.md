# Transform us as you, transfigured

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (PICARDY)

Transform us as you, transfigured,
Stood apart on Tabor’s height.
Lead us up our sacred mountains,
Search us with revealing light.
Lift us from where we have fallen,
Full of questions, filled with fright.

Transform us as you, transfigured,
Once spoke with those holy ones.
We, surrounded by the witness
Of those saints whose work is done,
Live in this world as your Body,
Chosen daughters, chosen sons.

Transform us as you, transfigured,
Would not stay within a shrine.
Keep us from our great temptation
Time and truth we quickly bind,
Lead us down those daily pathways
Where our love is not confined.
Amen.
