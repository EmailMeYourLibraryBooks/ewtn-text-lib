# Heal me, hands of Jesus

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Heal me, hands of Jesus, and search out all my pain;
restore my hope, remove my fear, and bring me peace again.

Cleanse me, blood of Jesus, take bitterness away;
let me forgive as one forgiven and bring me peace today.

Know me, mind of Jesus, and show me all my sin;
dispel the memories of guilt and bring me peace within.

Fill me, joy of Jesus; anxiety shall cease,
and heaven's serenity be mine, for Jesus brings me peace!

Save me, heart of Jesus, from all lifeâ€™s guilt and shame;
Resnew my sorrowing spirit, and free me from all blame.

Wash me, blessed Jesus, remove my every sin;
Cast out all doubt that clouds my mind; give me your peace within.
