# Come, follow me, the Savior spake

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 455 (vv. 1,2,4,5)

"Come, follow me," the Savior spake,
"all in my way abiding;
deny yourselves, the world forsake,
obey my call and guiding.
O bear the cross, whate'er betide,
take my example for your guide.

"I am the light, I light the way,
a godly life displaying;
I bid you walk as in the day,
I keep your feet from straying.
I am the way, and well I show
how you must sojourn here below.

"I teach you how to shun and flee
what harms your soul's salvation,
your heart from ev'ry guile to free,
from sin and its temptation.
I am the refuge of the soul
and lead you to your heav'nly goal."

Then let us follow Christ our Lord
and take the cross appointed
and, firmly clinging to his Word,
in suff'ring be undaunted.
For those who bear the battle's strain
the crown of heav'nly life obtain.
