# Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes

***

## Setting: Thomas Attwood

Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,
teach me, teach me the way of thy statutes;
I shall keep it, and I shall keep it
unto the end, and I shall keep it,
and I shall keep it, and I shall keep it,
unto the end,
And I shall keep it unto the end.

Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,
teach me, teach me the way of thy statutes;
I shall keep it, and I shall keep it
unto the end, and I shall keep it,
and I shall keep it, and I shall keep it,
unto the end,
And I shall keep it unto the end.

Teach me, O Lord, O Lord, the way of thy statutes,
And I shall keep it, and I shall keep it,
And I shall keep it unto the end,
And I shall keep it unto the end,
unto the end.
