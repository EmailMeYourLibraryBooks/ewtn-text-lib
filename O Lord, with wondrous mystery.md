# O Lord, with wondrous mystery

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 384

O Lord, with wondrous mystery
You take our bread and wine,
And make of these two humble things
Yourself, our Lord divine.
Our wheat and drink become our light,
Our altar bears your awful might;
O Lord, we thank you for the gift
That lies before our sight.

You are the same, our Christ and Lord,
Who blessed the supper room;
You are the God who died and rose 
Triumphant from the tomb.
This host bears your divinity,
This cup contains infinity;
The mystery fills our souls with love,
O Holy majesty.
