# Sing with all the saints in glory

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Sing with all the sons of glory,
Sing the resurrection song!
Death and sorrow, earth's dark story,
To the "former days" belong.
Even now the dawn is breaking,
Soon the night of time shall cease,
And, in God's own likeness waking,
Man shall know eternal peace.

Oh, what glory, far exceeding
All that eye has yet perceived!
Holiest hearts, for ages pleading,
Never that full joy conceived.
God has promised, Christ prepares it,
There on high our welcome waits;
Every humble spirit shares it;
Christ has passed the eternal gates.

"Life eternal!" Heaven rejoices;
Jesus lives Who once was dead;
Join, O man, the deathless voices;
Child of God lift up thy head.
Patriarchs from distant ages,
Saints all longing for their heaven,
Prophets, psalmists, seers, and sages,
All await the glory given.

"Life eternal!" Oh, what wonders
Crowd on faith--what joy unknown,
When, amidst earth's closing thunders,
Saints shall stand before the throne!
Oh! to enter that bright portal,
See that glowing firmament,
Know, with Thee, O God immortal,
"Jesus Christ, Whom Thou hast sent!"

## Setting: Lumen Christi

Sing with all the saints in glory,
Sing the resurrection song!
Death and sorrow, earth's dark story,
To the former days belong.
All around the clouds are breaking,
Soon the storms of time shall cease,
In God's likeness, man awaking,
Knows the everlasting peace.

O what glory, far exceeding
All that eye has yet perceived!
Holiest hearts, for ages pleading,
Never that full joy conceived.
God has promised, Christ prepares it,
There on high our welcome waits;
Every humble spirit shares it;
Christ has passed the eternal gates.

Life eternal! Heaven rejoices;
Jesus lives Who once was dead;
Join, O man, the deathless voices;
Child of God lift up your head.
Patriarchs from distant ages,
Saints all longing for their heaven,
Prophets, psalmists, seers, and sages,
All await the glory given.

Life eternal! O what wonders
Crowd on faith; what joy unknown,
When, amidst earth's closing thunders,
Saints shall stand before the throne!
O to enter that bright portal,
See that glowing firmament,
Know, with you, O God immortal,
Jesus Christ, Whom you have sent!
