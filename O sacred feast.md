# O sacred feast

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

O sacred Feast wherein Christ is received,
The memory of his passion is renewed in us,
Our souls are filled with grace,
And the pledge of everlasting glory 
is given unto us.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia, 
Alleluia, alleuia, alleluia.

O sacred Feast wherein Christ is received,
The memory of his passion is renewed in us,
Our souls are filled with grace,
And the pledge of everlasting glory

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
