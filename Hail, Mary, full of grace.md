## Setting: EWTM Hymn Supplement (ADAM'S FLOWER)

Hail, Mary, full of grace,
Hail, flower of Adam’s race,
Who gave the Son of God a dwelling;
He found a place of rest
Within your sinless breast:
Oh wonderful beyond all telling!

Hail, Queen enthroned above,
Hail, miracle of love
And wondrous work of God’s perfection;
O lovely morning star
Clear shining from afar,
We sinners hope for your protection.

Through you all graces flow
To men on earth below;
Through you is every favor given;
Help us to conquer sin
That we may enter in
Through you, O blessed gate, to heaven.
