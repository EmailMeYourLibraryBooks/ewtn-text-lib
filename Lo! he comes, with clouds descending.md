# Lo! he comes, with clouds descending

## Adoremus Hymnal 304 (ST. THOMAS)

Lo! he comes, with clouds descending,
Once for our salvation slain;
Thousand thousand saints attending
Swell the triumph of his train:
Alleluia, alleluia! 
Christ the Lord returns to reign.

Every eye shall now behold him,
Robed in dreadful majesty;
Those who set at naught and sold him,
Pierced, and nailed him to the tree:
Deeply wailing, deeply wailing,
Shall the true Messiah see.

Those dear tokens of his passion
Still his dazzling body bears,
Cause of endless exultation
To his ransomed worshippers:
With what rapture, with what rapture,
Gaze we on those glorious scars!

Yea, Amen! let all adore thee,
High on thine eternal throne;
Savior, take the power and glory; 
Claim the kingdom for thine own:
Alleluia, alleluia!
Thou shalt reign, and thou alone.
