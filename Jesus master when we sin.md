# Jesus, master, when we sin

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Jesus, Master, when we sin,
Turn on us thy healing face;
It will melt the offence within
Into penitential grace.

Beam on our bewildered mind
Till its dreamy shadows flee;
Stones cry our where thou hast shined,
Jesus, musical with thee.

To the Father and the Son
And the Spirit, who, in heaven
Ever witness, three and one,
Praise on earth be ever given.
