# Give thanks to God, call on his name

***

## Setting: Banks (WAREHAM)

Give thanks to God, call on his name;
And make his deeds to nations known:
Sing ye, in sacred hymns, his praise;
Let all his wondrous works be shown.

Remember what great works he wrought;
What judgments from his mouth proceed;
O ye his servants, Abrahamâ€™s race,
Give thanks and to his Word give heed.

When famine went throughout the land,
At length which break the staff of bread.
He then a man named Joseph sent;
Who sold a slave, to Egypt was led.

The king his royal edict gave,
To set him free from all his bands.
He made him lord of all his house,
And ruler over all his lands.

Praise now his holy name, and let
Your hearts rejoice that seek the Lord.
Seek ye the Lord, his strength and face;
Thus ever be the Lord adored.
