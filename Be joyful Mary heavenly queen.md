Be joyful, Mary, heav'nly queen,
Gaude, Maria:
Your Son who died was living seen,
Alleluia, laetare, O Maria.

The Son you bore by heaven's grace,
Gaude, Maria:
Did all our guilt and sin efface,
Alleluia, laetare, O Maria.

The Lord has risen from the dead,
Gaude, Maria:
He rose with might as he had said,
Alleluia, laetare, O Maria.

Then pray to God, O Virgin fair,
Gaude, Maria:
That he our souls to heaven bear,
Alleluia, laetare, O Maria.
