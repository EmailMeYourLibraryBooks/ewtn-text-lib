# We know that Christ is raised

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 283

We know that Christ is raised and dies no more.
Embraced by death he broke its fearful hold;
And our despair he turned to blazing joy.
Alleluia!

We share by water in his saving death.
Reborn we share with him an Easter life
As living members of a living Christ.
Alleluia!

The Father's splendor clothes the Son with life.
The Spirit's power shakes the Church of God.
Baptized we live with God the Three in One.
Alleluia!

A new creation comes to life and grows
As Christ's new body takes on flesh and blood.
The universe restored and whole will sing:
Alleluia!
