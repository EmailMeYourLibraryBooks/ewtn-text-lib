# Holy Father, we your children

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Holy father, we your children
With all joy your praises sing:
O how wondrous great your power
With the Christ, our God and King.

Holy father, keep us humble,
Make us pure as you were pure;
Strongest purposes will crumble
If we boast and are too sure.

Holy father, make us prayerful,
Sin and dangers are all â€˜round;
Bring us Jesus, bring us Mary,
We shall conquer and be crowned.
