# God's Law is perfect, and converts

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Roby)

God's law is perfect and converts
the soul in sin that lies:
God's testimony is most sure
and makes the simple wise.

The statutes of the Lord are right
and do rejoice the heart:
the Lord's command is pure,
and doth light to the eyes impart.

Unspotted is the fear of God
and ever doth endure:
the judgements of the Lord are true
together, right and sure.

They more than gold, yea much fine gold,
to be desired are
than honey, honey from the comb
that droppeth, sweeter far.

Moreover, they thy servants warn
how they their life should frame:
a great reward provided is
for them that keep the same.
