# Spread, O spread, thou mighty word

***

## Setting: The Hymnal 1982 530 (reproduced in EWTN Hymn Supplement)

Spread, O spread, thou mighty word,
spread the kingdom of the Lord,
that to earth’s remotest bound
all may heed the joyful sound;

word of how the Father’s will
made the world, and keeps it, still;
how his only Son he gave,
earth from sin and death to save;

word of how the Savior’s love
earth’s sore burden doth remove;
how for ever, in its need,
through his death the world is freed;

word of how the Spirit came
bringing peace in Jesus’ name;
how his neverfailing love
guides us on to heaven above.
