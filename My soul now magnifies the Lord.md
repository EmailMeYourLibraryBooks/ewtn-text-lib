# My soul now magnifies the Lord

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 180

My soul now magnifies the Lord;
My spirit leaps for joy in him.
He keeps me in his kind regard,
And I am blest for time to come.

For he alone who shows such might
Has done amazing things to me.
His mercy flows; his name like light
Remains in time perpetually.

His arm is strong; his strength is great.
He scatters those of proud intent,
And casts them down from high estate;
Then gives the low his nourishment.

He feeds the hungry as his own;
The wealthy leave with empty hands.
He gives his help to Israel;
His gracious promise always stands.
