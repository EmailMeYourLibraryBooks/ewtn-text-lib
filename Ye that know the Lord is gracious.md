# Ye that know the Lord is gracious

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (Raquel)

Ye that know the Lord is gracious,
Ye for whom a cornerstone
Stands, of God elect and precious,
Laid that ye may build thereon,
See that on that sure foundation
Ye a living temple raise,
Towâ€™rs that may tell forth salvation,
Walls that may reecho praise.

Living stones, by God appointed
Each to its allotted place,
Kings and priests, by God anointed,
Shall ye not declare his grace?
Ye, a royal generation, 
tell the tidings of your birth,
tidings of a new creation
to an old and weary earth.

Tell the praise of him who called you
Out of darkness into light,
Broke the fetters that enthralled you,
Gave you freedom, peace and sight:
Tell the tale of sins forgiven,
Strength renewed and hope restored,
Till the earth, in tune with heaven,
Praise and magnify the Lord.
