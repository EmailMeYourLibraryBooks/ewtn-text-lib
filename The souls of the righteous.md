# The Souls of the Righteous

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

The souls of the righteous 
Are in the hands of God,
And no torment can o’ertake them,
No torment can o’ertake them.
In the eyes of the foolish,
They seemed to be dead,
And their passing away
Was reckoned a misfortune,
And their departure from us as their ruin.
But they are at peace;
They are at peace.
Those who trust in him will know truth,
And the faithful who dwell
With him in love, in love.
