O come, all ye faithful,  
Joyful and triumphant,  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;  
Come and behold him,  
Born the King of angels;  
O come let us adore him,
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.  

God of God,  
Light of Light,  
Lo! he abhors not the Virginâ€™s womb:  
Very God,  
Begotten not created;  
O come let us adore him,
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.   

Sing, choirs of angels,  
Sing in exultation,  
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above,  
Glory to God in the highest;  
O come let us adore him,
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.   

Yea, Lord we greet thee,  
Born this happy morning;  
Jesus, to thee be glory given;  
Word of the Father, 
Now in flesh appearing;  
O come let us adore him,
O come let us adore him
O come let us adore him,
Christ the Lord.
