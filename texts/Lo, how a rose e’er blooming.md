# Lo, how a rose e’er blooming

***

## AH.329

Lo, how a rose e’er blooming  
From tender stem hath sprung!  
Of Jesse’s lineage coming  
As prophets long have sung.  
It came, a flow’ret bright,  
Amid the cold of winter,  
When half-spent was the night.  

Isaiah ’twas foretold it,  
The Rose I have in mind.  
With Mary we behold it,  
The virgin Mother kind.  
To show God’s love aright,  
She bore to us a Savior,  
When half-spent was the night.    

O Flow’r, whose fragrance tender  
With sweetness fills the air.  
Dispel in glorious splendor  
The darkness ev’rywhere:  
True man, yet very God.  
From sin and death now save us,  
And share our ev’ry load.
