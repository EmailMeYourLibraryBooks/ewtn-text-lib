# The supper of the Lamb to share

***

## Setting: Saint Jean Brébeuf Hymnal 46

The Supper of the Lamb to share,
We come in vesture white and fair,
The Red Sea crossed, our hymn we sing
To Christ, our Captain and our King.

His holy body on the cross,
Parched, on that altar hyng for us;
Partaking of His sacred blood,
We live upon the living God.

Protected in the Paschal night
From the destroying angel’s might,
And by a powerful hand set free
From Pharaoh’s bitter slavery.

For Christ our Possover is slain.
The Lamb is offered not in vain;
Sincerity’s unleavened bread,
His flesh He gave His blood He shed.

O Victim ever worthy, who
Didst all the bonds of hell undo,
Didst ransom captives from the foe
And life, thy gift, afresh bestow!

When Christ from out the tomb arose,
Victor o’er hell and all His foes,
The tyrant down in chains He threw,
And planted Paradise anew.
