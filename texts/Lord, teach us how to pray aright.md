# Lord, teach us how to pray aright

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Roby)

Lord, teach us how to pray aright
with rev'rence and with fear.
Tho' dust and ashes in Your sight,
we may, we must draw near.

We perish if we cease from prayer;
O, grant us pow'r to pray.
And when to meet You we prepare,
Lord, meet us on our way.

Give deep humility; the sense
of godly sorrow give;
a strong desire with confidence,
to hear Your voice and live;

Faith in the only sacrifice
that can for sin atone;
to cast our hopes, to fix our eyes
on Christ, on Christ alone.

Give these, and then Your will be done;
thus strengthened with all might,
we, thro' Your Spirit and Your Son,
shall pray, and pray aright.
