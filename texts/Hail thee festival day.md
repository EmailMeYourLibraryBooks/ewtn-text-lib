# Hail thee, festival day

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 414 (Easter)

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Lo, the fair beauty of earth,
from the death of the winter arising!
Every good gift of the year
now with its Master returns: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

He who was nailed to the cross
is Lord and the ruler of nature;
all things created on earth
sing to the glory of God: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Daily the loveliness grows,
adorned with glory of blossom;
heaven her gates unbars,
flinging her increase of light: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Rise from the grave now, O Lord,
who art author of life and creation.
Treading the pathway of death,
life thou bestowest on all: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

God the Creator, the Lord,
who rulest the earth and the heavens,
guard us from harm without,
cleanse us from evil within: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Jesus the health of the world,
enlighten our minds, thou Redeemer,
Son of the Father supreme,
only-begotten of God: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Spirit of life and of power,
now flow in us, fount of our being,
light that dost lighten all,
life that in all dost abide: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.

Praise to the Giver of good!
Thou Love who art author of concord,
pour out thy balm on our souls,
order our ways in thy peace: 

Hail, thee festival day!
Blest day to be hallowed for ever,
day wherein Christ arose,
breaking the kingdom of death.
