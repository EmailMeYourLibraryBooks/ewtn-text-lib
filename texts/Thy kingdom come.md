# Thy kingdom come, on bended knee

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

"Thy kingdom come!" on bended knee  
the passing ages pray;  
and faithful souls have yearned to see  
on earth that kingdom's day.  

But the slow watches of the night  
not less to God belong;  
and for the everlasting right  
the silent stars are strong.  

And lo, already on the hills  
the flags of dawn appear;  
gird up your loins, ye prophet souls,  
proclaim the day is near:  

the day to whose clear shining light  
all wrong shall stand revealed,  
when justice shall be throned in might,  
and every hurt be healed;  

when knowledge, hand in hand with peace,  
shall walk the earth abroad;  
the day of perfect righteousness,  
the promised day of God.
