## Setting: POOR CLARE

O Light from Light, all splendor’s Source,
Whose clear beams shine in radiant course,
We give you thanks for dear Saint Clare
And for her holiness oh so rare.

Enticed by Francis’ preaching sweet,
the Crucified she did entreat;
She gathered sisters to her side; 
Poverty with them e’er to abide.

She left behind all earthly gain
That riches true might on her rain;
Poverty chastity she wed,
And by obedience her heart was led.

As mother to her flock, she lived
And modeled Christ—unrivaled gift;
In loving service spent her life
In true devotion, her Lord her guide.

To the Lord’s Body and his Blood;
To the Real Presence understood;
To Jesus’ Heart—all-burning Love—
she, the Poor Clare, did kneel in awe.

As she has shown us, Lord, your way,
So give us strength like hers today,
That we may turn from self to you 
And in such freedom your work to do.

Most high, O Father, loving Lord,
With Son and Spirit, we adore.
With Mother Clare and all the blest
Bring us, your Church, to ne’erending rest.
