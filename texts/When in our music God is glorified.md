# When in our music God is glorified

***

## EWTN Hymn Supplement (ENGELBERG)

When in our music God is glorified,
and adoration leaves no room for pride,
it is as though the whole creation cried:
Alleluia!

How oft, in making music, we have found
a new dimension in the world of sound
as worship moved us to a more profound
Alleluia!

So has the Church, in liturgy and song,
in faith and love, through centuries of wrong,
borne witness to the truth in ev’ry tongue,
Alleluia!

And did not Jesus sing a psalm that night
when utmost evil strove against the light?
Then let us sing, for whom he won the fight:
Alleluia!

Let ev’ry instrument be tuned for praise,
let all rejoice who have a voice to raise,
and may God give us faith to sing always:
Alleluia!
