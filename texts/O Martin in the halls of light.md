### Setting: Hymn sheet (Roby, EISENACH)

O Martin, in the halls of light
You shine, a jewel resplendent, bright;
Come now to help us from above
And bring us tokens of your love.

A pattern of God’s love divine, You have been made ‘midst men to shine;
May every nation in you see
The image of Christ’s charity.

By God’s lifegiving Spirit led,
You cured the sick, the needy fed;
Your kind heart sheltered orphans small:
They called you Father of them all.

May charity which knows no bound
In everyone be always found,
And Christ’s same peace on all men shine,
Redeemed by his same Blood divine.
Amen.
