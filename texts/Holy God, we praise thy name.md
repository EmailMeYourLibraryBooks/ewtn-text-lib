# Holy God, we praise thy name

***

## Setting: Saint Jean Br√©beuf Hymnal (vv. 1,3)

Holy God, we praise your name;
Lord of all, we bow before you.
All on earth your scepter claim,
All in heav'n above adore you.
Infinite your vast domain,
Everlasting is your reign.

Holy Father, holy Son,
Holy Spirit, three we name you,
Though in essence only one;
Undivided God we claim you
And, adoring, bend the knee
While we own the mystery.
