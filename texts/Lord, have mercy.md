# Lord, have mercy

***

## Setting: Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy

Lord! Lord!
Lord, have mercy, 
have mercy upon us,
have mercy upon us,
have mercy upon us, upon us,
have mercy on us, mercy on us,
and incline our hearts
to keep thy law.
Lord, have mercy, Lord,
have mercy on us,
and write all these thy laws
in our hearts, we beseech thee,
and write all these thy laws,
thy laws in our hearts, 
we beseech thee.
