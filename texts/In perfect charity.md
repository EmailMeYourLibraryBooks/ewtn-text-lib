# In perfect charity 

***

## Setting: Banks/DeBruyn

O most high and glorious God,
cast your light into the darkness of my heart.
Give me right faith, and certain hope,
and perfect, perfect charity.
Give me true insight Lord, and wisdom,
that I may always live within
your ever holy will.
Lord may your light within me burn,
shining out in perfect charity.

O most high and glorious God,
open wide the door that leads me to your love.
Give me your firm yet gentle strength;
may I live that perfect charity.
Lord, may your peace be ever in me,
that I may always seek to serve your children here on earth;
that I may find my hope wih you,
and live in perfect charity.

Then most high and thankful praise
I will sing unto the glory of your name:
To Father, Son, and Spirit bright,
Living Presence, perfect charity.
Praise to the Love that shines in splendor,
that lights the pathways of my heart,
and brings me close to you.
O Holy One, invite me in,
where you live in perfect charity.
