# I stand at the door and knock

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Behold, I stand at the door and knock;
And if anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
I will come in and eat with him,
and he with me.

He who conquers, I will grant him
to sit with me on my throne,
as I myself conquered and sat down
with my Father on his throne.

Behold, I stand at the door and knock;
And if anyone hears my voice and opens the door,
I will come in and eat with him,
and he with me.

For some are last who will be first,
And some are first who will be last.
