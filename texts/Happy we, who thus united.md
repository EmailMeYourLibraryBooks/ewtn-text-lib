# Happy we, who thus united

## EWS (IN BABILONE)

Happy we who thus united
Join in cheerful melody,
Praising Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
In the Holy Family.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, help us,
That we ever true may be
To the promises that bind us
To the Holy Family,
To the promises that bind us
To the Holy Family.

Jesus, whose Almighty bidding
All created things fulfil,
Lives on earth in meek subjection
To his earthly parents' will.
Sweetest Infant! make us patient,
And obedient for Thy sake;
Teach us to be chaste and gentle,
All our stormy passions break,
Teach us to be chaste and gentle,
All our stormy passions break.

Mary! thou alone wert chosen
To be Mother of thy Lord:
Thou didst guide the early footsteps
Of the great Incarnate Word.
Dearest Mother! make us humble,
For thy Son will take His rest
In the poor and lowly dwelling
Of a humble sinner's breast.

Joseph! thou wert called the Father
Of thy Maker and thy Lord;
Thine it was to save thy Saviour
From the cruel Herod's sword.
Suffer us to call thee Father,
Show to us a father's love;
Lead us safe through every danger
Till we meet in heaven above.
