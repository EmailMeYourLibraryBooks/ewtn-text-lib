# God, deigning man to be

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Love Unknown)

God, deigning man to be,
who in thy manhood strong,
summoned to walk with thee
Twelve from the common throng:
As thou didst call them from their ways,
Lord, call us too, who sing their praise!

Master, who walked the roads,
Kindling with living flame
Ancient and formal codes,
Leading the twelve who came:
As thou didst guide them in thy ways,
Lord teach us too, who sing their praise!

Victor upon thy throne,
Reigning on high again,
Sending the twelve, thine own,
Forth to the world of men:
As thou didst speed them on their ways,
Lord, send us too, who sing their praise!
