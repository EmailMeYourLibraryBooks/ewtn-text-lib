# By the Creator, Joseph was appointed

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

By the Creator, Joseph was appointed
spouse of the Virgin, guardian of the
Incarnate;
he by his caring ministered to Jesus,
source of salvation.
Christ in whose presence hosts of hell must
tremble,
Ruler of all things, Lord of earth and
heaven,
Monarch of monarchs, to his earthly father,
freely was subject.
To God eternal be all praise and glory,
who to Saint Joseph gave supernal honor;
grant that we also may like him be faithful
in our obedience.
