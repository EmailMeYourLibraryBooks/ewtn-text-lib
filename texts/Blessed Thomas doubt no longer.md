# Blessed Thomas, doubt no longer

***

## EWTN Hymn Supplement

Blessed Thomas, doubt no longer,
see the wounds in hand and side,
Now behold the risen Savior
who for thee has bled and died,
And from death’s dark pit arising,
lives in body glorified.

Here behold the love victorious,
over death triumphant now,
See the feet where nails were driven,
and thy faith in him avow;
For he lives, the world’s redeemer,
unto whom all knees shall bow.

Thomas, sight has now convinced thee,
faith within thy heart has stirred;
Blessed more those faithful servants,
trusting in the Savior’s word,
Who, through vistion is denied them,
still believe, and own him Lord.

Grant, O Father, that among them
we thy servants may be known,
And the ground be ever fruitful
where the seed of faith was sown,
Till at length in heaven’s glory,
faith and vision are but one.
