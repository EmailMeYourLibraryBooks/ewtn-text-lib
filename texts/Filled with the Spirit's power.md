# Filled with the Spirit's power

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Filled with the Spirit's power, with one accord
the infant Church confessed its risen Lord.
O Holy Spirit, in the Church today
no less your power of fellowship display.

Now with the mind of Christ set us on fire,
that unity may be our great desire.
Give joy and peace;, give faith to hear your call,
and readiness in each to work for all.

Widen our love, good Spirit, to embrace
in our strong care the men of every race.
Like wind and fir, with life among us move,
till we are known as Christ's, and Christians prove.
