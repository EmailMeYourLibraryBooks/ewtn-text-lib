# O Christ, our light, O Radiance true

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 380

O Christ, our light, O Radiance true,
Shine forth on those estranged from you,
And bring them to your home again,
Where their delight shall never end.

Fill with the radiance of your grace
The wanderers lost in error’s maze.
Enlighten those who to express
The faith their secret hearts confess.

Lord, open all reluctant ears
And take away the childish fears
Of those who tremble to express
The faith their secret hearts confess

Lord let your mercy’s gentle ray
Shine down on others strayed away.
To those in consience wounded sore
Show heaven’s waiting, open door.

Make theirs with ours a single voice
uplifted, ever to rejoice
With wondering gratitude and praise
To you, O Lord, for boundless grace.
