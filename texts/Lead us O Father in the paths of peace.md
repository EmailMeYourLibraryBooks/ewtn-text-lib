# Lead us, O Father, in the paths of peace

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Banks)

Lead us, O Father, in the paths of peace;
Without thy guiding hand we go astray,
And doubts appall, and sorrows still increase;
Lead us through Christ, the true and living Way.

Lead, O Father, in the paths of right;
Blindly we stumble when we walk alone,
Involved in shadows of a darksome night;
Only with thee we jorney safely on.

Lead us, O Father, to thy heavenly rest,
However rough and steep the path may be;
Through joy of sorrow, as thou deemest blest,
Until our lives are perfected in thee.
