# Lord, who didst send by two and two

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Lord, who didst send by two and two before Thee,
Thine own disciples, those three score and ten,
That they should show the lost ones where the path was
And bring the light to eyes of blinded men:

Make us to see the light that shines in all men,
Help us to learn how thorns can make a crown,
Show us how love will keep ourselves from falling
And pity lift up others who are down.

Thou art our Captain: teach us to be like thee,
And where thou leadest we will follow on;
We do not know what orders may await us,
Save the great order, "Let Thy will be done."

It shall be done, if we be strong to follow
The path which led thee to that aweful day;
It shall be done, if true to thy example
We guide ourselves and others in thy way.
