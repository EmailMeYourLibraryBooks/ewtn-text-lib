# Rod of the Root of Jesse

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Rod of the root of Jesse, 
Thou Flow'r of Mary born,
From that thick shady mountain
Cam'st glorious forth this morn:
OF her, the ever Virgin,
Incarnate wast thou made,
The immaterial Essence,
The God by all obeyed!

The Gentile's expectation,
Whom Jacob's word foretell,
Who Syria's pride shall vanquish,
Samaria's pride shall quell;
Thou from the Root of Judah
Like some fair plant dost spring,
To turn old Gentile error
To Thee, its God and King!

In Balaam's ancient vision
The Easter seers were skilled,
They marked the constellations,
And joy their spirits filled:
For Thou, Bright Star of Jacob,
Arising in Thy might,
Didst call these Gentiles first-fruits
To worship in Thy light.

As on a fleece descending
The gentle dews distill,
As drops the earth that water,
The Virgin didst thou fill.
For Media, segued with Sheba,
Falls down and worships Thee:
Tarshish and Ethiopia, 
The isles and Araby.
