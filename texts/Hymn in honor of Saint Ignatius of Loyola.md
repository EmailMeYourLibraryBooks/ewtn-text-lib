# Hymn in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Your greater glory, Lord,
Ignatius solely sought
With Christ to rule by love
his every deed and thought.
His time, his world he strove
to mold and make anew
In faith, in love, in hope
and service, Lord, to you.

Ignatius, pray that we,
like you, take fire and burn
To give, to fight, to toil
that all the world may learn
Of justice, truth and peace
his presence here in all,
That counting not the cost
we generous be in all.

Your greater glory, Lord,
Ignatius solely sought,
And seeking, showed to us
what battles must be fought
To see your kingdom come
like fire upon our earth,
That one in voice, in heart
one only world proclaim.

The glory, the glory, the glory of your name.
