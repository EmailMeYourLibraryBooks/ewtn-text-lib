# Dear crown of all the virgin choir

***

## Setting: Thaxton

Dear Crown of all the virgin choir!
That holy Mother's Virgin Son!
Who is, alone of womankind,
Mother and Virgin, both in one.

Encircled by Thy Virgin band,
Amid the lilies Thou art found;
For thy pure brides with lavish hand
Scattering immortal graces round.

And still wherever Thou dost bend
Thy lovely steps, O glorious King,
Virgins upon Thy steps attend, 
And hymns to Thy high glory sing.

Keep us, O Purity divine, 
from every least corruption free;
Our every sense from sin refine,
And purify our souls for Thee.

To God the Father, and the Son,
All honor, glory, praise be given;
With Thee, coequal Paraclete!
For evermore in Earth and Heaven.
