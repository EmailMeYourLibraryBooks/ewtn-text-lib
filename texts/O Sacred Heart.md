# O Sacred Heart! Heart of Jesus dear

***

## Setting: Saint Basil's Hymnal 21

O Sacred Heart! O Heart of Jesus dear!
O Sacred heart aflame with love divine;
Take Thou my heart, draw me each day more near;
Take Thou my heart and let it rest in Thine;
Take Thou my heart and let it rest in Thine.

Pierced by the lance on Calvaryâ€™s cruel Tree,
A saving Flood of priceless graces poured,
From His dear Heart, whose Blood was shed for me;
The Sacred Heart, the loving Heart of God;
The Sacred Heart, the loving heart of God.

O Sacred Heart, true source of heavenly bliss;
Of peace divine which Thou alone canst give;
What sweeter lot could mortal ask than this
To die for Thee, with Thee in heaven to be?
To die for Thee, with Thee in heaven to be?
