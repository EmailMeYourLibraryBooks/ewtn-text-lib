## CVH.216 GESÙ BAMBINO

When blossoms flowered 'mid the snows
Upon a winter night,
Was born the Child, the Christmas Rose,
The King of love and light.
The angels sang, the shepherds sang,
The grateful earth rejoiced;
And at his blessed birth the stars
Their exultation voiced.

O come, let us adore him; (Venite adoremus;)
O come, let us adore him; (venite adoremus;)
O come, let us adore him, (venite adoremus,)
Christ the Lord. (Dominum.)

Again the heart with rapture glows,
To greet the holy night,
That gave the earth its Christmas Rose,
Its King of love and light.
Let ev'ry voice acclaim his name,
The grateful chorus swell;
From Paradise to earth he came
That we with him might dwell. 

O come, let us adore him; (Venite adoremus;)
O come, let us adore him; (venite adoremus;)
O come, let us adore him, (venite adoremus,)
Christ the Lord. (Dominum.)
