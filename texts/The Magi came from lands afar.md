# The Magi came from lands afar

***

## Timothy Paul Banks

The Magi came from lands afar,  
Led by the guidance of a star,  
They journeyed on to Bethlehem,  
To seek the Savior, born for them.  
And there in humble stable home,  
Unto the heavenly Child they come;  
And low before Him bend the knee  
In love and deep humility.

Nor do they come with empty hands  
They bring the treasure of their lands;  
Their costliest gifts they offer thence  
Of gold and myrrh and frankincense.  
They seek the Light, in darkness drear,  
And lo, the morn broke full and clear;  
The very Light of Light they see,  
Though hidden in obscurity.

The incense cloud, with fragrance rare,  
The presence of a God declare;  
Lo! kings in adoration fall,  
For Maryâ€™s son is Lord of all.  
Our gold upon Thine altar lies;  
Our prayers to Thee, as incense, rise;  
Accept as myrrh our tears and sighs:  
O King, O Sacrifice!
