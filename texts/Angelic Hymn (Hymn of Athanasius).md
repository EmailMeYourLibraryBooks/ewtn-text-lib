# Angelic Hymn (Hymn of Athanasius)

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

As the heavenly angels who praise you in the heights,
we who are frail and sinful offer you praise.
At all times and each day of our lives,
we bless you and praise your holy and eternal name.
Blessed are You, Lord, Upholder of all,
God of our Fathers,
Your name is blessed and glorified with praises forever.
To you belongs glory, to you belongs praise,
To you belongs honor, God of all, Father of truth;
We praise you with your only son, and the living Holy Spirit,
now and always and forever and ever.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
