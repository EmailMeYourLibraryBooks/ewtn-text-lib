# Bring a torch, Jeanette, Isabella

***

## Timothy Paul Banks

Bring a torch, Jeanette, Isabella,  
Bring a torch to the cradle, come.  
It is Jesus, good folk of the village!  
Christ is born, and Maryâ€™s calling  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Mother,  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Child!

Skies are glowing, the heavens are cloudless,  
Light is flowing, arise from your bed.  
Haste and go now to see little Jesus  
shining bright as yonder star.  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Mother,  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Child!

It is wrong when the baby is sleeping,  
It is wrong to speak so loud.  
Silence now as you come to the cradle,  
Lest you awaken little Jesus,  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Mother,  
Ah! Ah! Beautiful is the Child!
