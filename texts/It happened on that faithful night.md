# It happened on that faithful night

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 127

It happened on that fateful night
when pow'rs of earth and hell arose
against the Son, our God's delight,
and friends betrayed him to his foes.

Before the bitter scene began,
he took the bread and blessed and broke.
What love through all his actions ran!
What wondrous words of love he spoke!

"My body broken for your sin
receive and eat as living food."
He took the cup and blessed the wine:
"Share this new testament, my blood!"

"Do this," he said, "till time shall end,
remembering your dying friend;
meet at my table and record
the full obedience of the Lord."

Lord, your feast we celebrate:
we show your death, we sing your name
till you return, when we shall eat
the marriage supper of the Lamb.
