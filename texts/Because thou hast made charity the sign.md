# Because thou hast made charity the sign

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Because thou hast made charity the sign
Of those who are thine own and follow thee,
Free us, O Lord, from hatredâ€™s cold design
And make us all one soul, one heart in thee.

Take from our hearts the darkness which impedes
The splendor of thy love that makes us one;
Pity our weakness, Lord, who come to plead
Now with a single voice before thy throne.

Make of our separate lives a single bread,
Merge all our lifeblood into one pure wine,
Who at thy banquet table, Lord, are fed
Who hope to share the eternal Feast Divine.
