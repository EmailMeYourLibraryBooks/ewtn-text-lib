# Thou goest to Jerusalem

***

## Setting: Melchior Franck

Thou goest to Jerusalem,
O Son of God to suffer
And for a world of sinful men
Thy spotless life to offer;
Thou bearest anguish, pain and loss,
The mocker’s scorn, the scourge, the cross,
To win for us salvation.

Before thee lies gethsemane,
The scene of bitter anguish;
Thine eyes behold the Calvary
Where thou in pain must languish;
The bleeding wounds, the bitter gall,
The crown of thorns, the judgment hall,
Thy burdened soul’s affliction.

Thou art the way, the Truth, the Life;
We pray thee, master, lead us
Away from earth’s vain restless strife;
With heavenly manna feed us.
Thou who hast died to save the lost,
Help us, dear Lord, to weight the cost
And follow thee, our Savior.
