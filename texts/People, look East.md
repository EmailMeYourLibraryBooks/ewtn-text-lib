# People, look East

***

## Setting: Gather Comprehensive 337 (omit v. 3)

People, look East. The time is near
Of the crowning of the year.
Make your house fair as you are able,
Trim the hearth and set the table.
People look East and sing today:
Love the Guest is on the way.

Furrows be glad. Though earth is bare.
One more seed is planted there:
Give up your strength the seed to nourish,
That in course the flower may flourish.
People look East and sing today:
Love the Rose is on the way.

Stars keep the watch. When night is dim
One more light the bowl shall brim,
Shining beyond the frosty weather,
Bright as sun and moon together.
People look East and sing today:
Love the Star is on the way.

Angels announce with shouts of mirth
Him who brings new life to earth.
Set every peak and valley humming
With the word, the Lord is coming.
People look East and sing today:
Love the Lord is on the way.
