# O Christ, you are our light and day

***

## Setting: Lumen Christi Hymnal 175

O Christ, you are our Light and Day:
Repel the shadows of the night;
You are the true Light, we believe;
You shed your radiance on the blest.

So we beseech you, holy Lord,
To keep us safe throughout the dark;
In you may we find quiet repose:
Please give to us a tranquil night.

Though sleep be given to our eyes,
Our hearts shall vigil keep with you;
Ever protect by your right hand
The faithful who delight in you.

Look down and be our sure defense,
Suppress all things that could bring harm;
And govern all your servants, whom
Your precious Blood has now redeemed.

To you, O Christ, our loving King,
All glory, honor, praise be given;
The Father, too, let us adore,
And Holy Spirit, evermore. Amen.
