# O Lord, I am not worthy

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 512

O Lord, I am not worthy
That thou should'st come to me:
But speak the word of comfort,
My spirit healed shall be.

And humbly I'll receive thee,
The bridegroom of my soul,
No more by sin to grieve thee
Or fly thy sweet control.

Eternal Holy Spirit,
Unworthy though I be,
Prepare me to receive him
And trust the Word to me.

Increase my faith, dear Jesus,
In thy real presence here,
And make me feel most deeply
That thou to me art near.

My hope in thee now strengthen.
O Savior of my soul,
Lest by temptation blinded,
I turn from my true goal.

And let me love thee only
With all my heart and mind;
In thee alone my spirit
True rest and joy can find.

O Sacrament most holy,
O Sacrament divine.
All praise and all thanksgiving
Be every moment thine.
