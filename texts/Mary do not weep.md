# Mary, do not weep

***

## Setting: Gregory K. Evans

Very early on the Sunday morning,
Just as the sun was rising,
Mary Magdalene came to the tomb.
My heart is on fire; I desire to see my Lord;
I look for him, but I cannot find where they have laid him.
Mary was weeping and she looked into the tomb;
There she saw two angels in brilliant clothes, saying:
Mary, do not weep, do not weep,
He is risen from the dead.
When Jesus had risen from the dead
Early on the Sunday morning,
He appeared first to Mary Magdalene,
From whom he had cast out seven devils.
Go to my brethren and tell them:
Mary, do not weep, do not weep,
He is risen, he is risen!
