# Awed by the beauty of thy virginity

***

## Setting: Evans

Awed by the beauty of thy virginity
and exceeding radiance of thy purity,
Gabriel called out unto thee,
O Mother of God: 
What worthy hymn of praise can I offer unto thee?
And what shall I name thee?
I am in doubt and stand in awe!
Wherefore as commanded I cry unto thee,
Rejoice, rejoice, O Full of Grace!
