# Lift up your voice

***

Setting: Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck

Lift up your voice and sing a new song,
Lift up your voice and sing a new song,
In every land tell out his glory,
In every land tell out his glory.
O sing, O sing, and bless his holy name,
And bless his holy name,
And bless his holy name.
And from day to day celebrate
The good news of the earth’s redemption,
The good news of the earth’s redemption,
The goodnews of the earth’s redemption,
The goodnews of the earth’s redemption.
O sing, O sing, and bless his holy name,
And bless his holy name,
And bless his holy name.
And from day to day celebrate
The good news of the earth’s redemption,
The good news of the earth’s redemption,
The goodnews of the earth’s redemption,
The goodnews of the earth’s redemption,
Earth’s redemption.
