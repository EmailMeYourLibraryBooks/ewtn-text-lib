## LBW.044

Infant holy, infant lowly,  
For his bed a cattle stall;  
Oxen lowing, little knowing  
Christ the child is Lord of all.  
Swiftly winging, angels singing,  
Bells are ringing, tidings bringing:  
Christ the child is Lord of all!   
Christ the child is Lord of all!  

Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping  
Vigil till the morning new  
Saw the glory, heard the story,  
Tidings of a Gospel true.  
Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow,  
Praises voicing, greet the morrow:  
Christ the child was born for you!  
Christ the child was born for you!
