# Mother of Christ, our hope, our Patroness

## EHS ROSEDALE

Mother of Christ, our hope, our patroness,
Star of the sea, our beacon in distress,
Guide to the shores of everlasting day
God’s holy people on their pilgrim way.

Virgin by vow but Mother of all grace;
Chosen by God to be his dwelling place,
Blessed are you: God’s word you did believe;
Your “Yes” undid the “No” of sinful Eve.

Daughter of God, who bore his holy One,
Dearest of all to Christ, your loving Son,
Show us his face, O Mother, as on earth,
Loving us all, you gave our Saviour birth.
