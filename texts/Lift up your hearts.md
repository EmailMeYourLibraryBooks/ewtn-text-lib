# Lift up your hearts

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (ELLERS)

“Lift up your hearts!” We lift them, Lord, to thee;
Here at thy feet none other may we see:
“Lift up your hearts!” E’en so, with one accord,
We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord.

Lift every gift that thou thyself hast given;
Low lies the best till lifted up to heaven:
Low lies bounding heart, the teeming mind,
Till, Maker known, they mount to heights divine.

Then, as the trumpet call in after years,
“Lift up your hearts!” rings joyous in our ears,
Still shall those hearts respond, with full accord,
“We lift them up, we lift them to the Lord!”
