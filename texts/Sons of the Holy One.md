# Sons of the Holy One

***

## Setting: Bach, arr. Thaxton (LIEBSTER EMMANUEL, Archangel verses)

Sons of the Holy One bright with his splendor,
Wakened to life at creation’s new day,
First to uplift in the joy of surrender,
Spirits to worship and wills to obey.

Gabriel came with his high salutation,
Burning with ardor and eager in flight.
“Ave Maria!” the dawn of salvation
Rose at its music and banished our night.

Praise God for Michael, in strife our defender,
Praise him for Raphael, our healer and guide,
Praise him for guardians, watchful and tender,
True to their charges in need a their side.
