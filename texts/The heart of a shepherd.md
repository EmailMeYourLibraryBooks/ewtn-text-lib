# The Heart of a Shepherd

***

## Setting: Rory Cooney

If you love me, feed my lambs;
Be my heart, my voice, my hands.
If you love me, feed my sheep.
And for my part,
I give you the heart of a shepherd.

Lord you are my shepherd;
there is nothing I shall want.
Fresh and green are the pastures,
where you give me repose.
Near restful waters you lead me,
to revive my drooping spirit.

You guide me along the right path;
you are true to your name.
If I should walk in the valley of darkness
no evil would I fear.
You are there with your crook and your staff;
with these you give me comfort.

You have prepared a banquet for me
in the sight of my foes.
My head you have anointed with oil;
my cup is over flowing.

Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me
all the days of my life.
In the Lordâ€™s own house shall I dwell
forever and ever.

To the Father and Son give glory,
give glory to the Spirit,
to God who is, who was, and who will be
for ever and ever.
