# The reign of God, like farmer's field

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

The reign of God, like farmerâ€™s field,
Bears weeds along with wheat;
The good and bad are intertwined
Till harvest is complete.

Like mustard tree, the reign of God
From tiny seed will spread,
Till birds of every feather come
To nest, and there be fed.

Though hidden now, the reign of God
May, yet unnoticed, grow;
From deep within it rises up
Like yeast in swelling dough.

The reign of God is come in Christ;
The reign of God is near.
Ablaze among us, kindling hearts
The reign of God is here!
