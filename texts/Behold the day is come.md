# Behold, the day is come

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Behold, the day is come;
The righteous Judge is near;
And sinners, trembling at their doom,
Shall soon their sentence hear.

Angels, in bright attire,
Conduct him through the skies;
Darkness and tempest, smoke and fire,
Attend him as he flies.

The whole creation groans;
But saints arise and sing;
They are the ransomed of the Lord,
And he their God and Kingar.
