# The vineyard of the Lord

***

## Setting: Banks (FRANCONIA)

The vineyard of the Lord
Before his laborers lies;
And lo! we see the vast reward
Which waits us in the skies.

O let us then proceed
In Godâ€™s great work below,
And, following our triumphant Head,
To further conquests go.

The Church of the firstborn,
We shall with them be blest,
And, crowned with endless joy, return
To our eternal rest.

What honor to behold,
In that sublime abode,
The patriarchs and prophets old,
And all the saints of God!

Then spend our days beneath,
Toiling in cheerful hope;
And fearless pass the vale of death,
And gain the mountaintop.
