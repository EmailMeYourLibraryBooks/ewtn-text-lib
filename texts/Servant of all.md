# Servant of all

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

I come to serve, not to be served;
My father’s grace is freely given, 
Though it be undeserved.
To no one is my right or left now given;
Preparedis that gift from my Father in heaven.

Though it be undeserved.
To no one is my right or left now given;
Preparedis that gift from my Father in heaven.

Whosoever will be great among you
Shall be your servant,
And whosoever will be first
Shall be the servant of all. Amen.
