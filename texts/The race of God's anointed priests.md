# The race of God's anointed priests

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

The roll of God’s anointed priests
shall never pass away;
Before his glorious face they stand,
and serve him night and day.

His holy priests, their eartly dross
consumed in sacred fire,
To God’s own heart their hearts ascend
in flame of deep desire;

The incense of their worship fills
His temple’s holiest place;
Their song with wonder fills the heavens,
the glad new song of grace.
