# Stephen, first of Christian martyrs

## EHS—NEH

Stephen, first of Christian martyrs,  
let the Church in hymns proclaim;  
Following close the Savior’s passion,  
Thus he won immortal fame:  
For his foes he prayed forgiveness  
While they stoned him unto death,  
To the Lord his soul commending  
As he yielded up his breath.  

Holy Spirit, gift of Jesus,  
Shed thy light upon our eyes,  
That we may behold with Stephen  
That fair realm beyond the skies,  
Where the Son of Man in glory  
Waits for us at God’s right hand,  
King of saints and hope of martyrs,  
Lord all the pilgrim band.  

See him who went on before us  
Heavenly mansions to prepare,  
Who for us is ever pleading  
By his wounds of glory there;  
In that blessed home of splendor  
Christ our Savior reigns above,  
Calling us to share his rapture  
In the Father’s boundless love.
