We magnify you, O Peter and Paul,
Apostles of the Lord, 
for ye have enlightened the world,
bringing the ends of the world to Christ.

The heavens are telling the glory of God,
and the firmament proclaims his handiwork.

We magnify you, O Peter and Paul,
Apostles of the Lord, 
for ye have enlightened the world,
bringing the ends of the world to Christ.

Glory to the Father and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit,
now and ever and unto ages. Amen.

We magnify you, O Peter and Paul,
Apostles of the Lord, 
for ye have enlightened the world,
bringing the ends of the world to Christ.
