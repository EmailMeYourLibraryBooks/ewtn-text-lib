# O praise the Lord, ye servants

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (OLD 124TH)

O praise the Lord, ye servants of the Lord,
Into his courts your joyful homage bring,
Ye that within his holy temple stand
Lift up your hands, lift up your voice and sing:
So shall ye have the blessing from your King.

He that hath made all heaven and all the worlds,
Shall from that Sion where his saints adore
Look down with favor, sanctify his Church,
Bless them that tread his sanctuary floor,
And keep them in his ways for evermore.

All glory now to God the Father's name;
Son everlasting, glory unto thee;
And, Holy Spirit, glory thine the same;
One God eternal, blessed Trinity,
As ever was, and evermore shall be. Amen.
