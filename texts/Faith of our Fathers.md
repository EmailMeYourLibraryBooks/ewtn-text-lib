# Faith of our Fathers

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 603 (vv. 1,2,4)

Faith of our fathers, living still,
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword;
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whenever we hear that glorious Word!
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
 
Faith of our fathers, Maryâ€™s prayers
Shall win all nations unto thee:
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall then indeed be free.
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
 
Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife;
And preach Thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
Faith of our fathers, holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death.
