# Thy Nativity, O Christ (Two Orthodox Hymns Setting B)

***

## Gregory Evans

Thy Nativity, O Christ our God,
Has shown to the world the light of wisdom.
For by it those who worshiped stars
were taught by a star to adore thee,
the Sun of righteousness and to know thee, 
the Orient from on high:
O Lord, glory to thee!
O Lord, glory to thee!
