## Timothy Paul Banks

Masters in this hall,
Hear the news today
Brought from over sea,
And ever I you pray.

Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we clear!
Holpen are the folk on Earth,
Born is God’s Son so dear.
Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we loud!
God today hath poor folk raised
And cast a-down the proud.

Going o’er the hills,
Through the milk-white snow,
Heard we angels singing,
While the wind did blow.

Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we clear!
Holpen are the folk on Earth,
Born is God’s Son so dear.
Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we loud!
God today hath poor folk raised
And cast a-down the proud.

This is Christ the Lord,
Masters, be ye glad!
Christmas is come in, 
And no one should be sad.

Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we clear!
Holpen are the folk on Earth,
Born is God’s Son so dear.
Nowell! Nowell! Nowell!
Nowell, sing we loud!
God today hath poor folk raised
And cast a-down the proud.
