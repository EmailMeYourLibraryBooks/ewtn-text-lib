## Martin Shaw, traditional text

Lully, lulla,
thou little tiny child,
by by, lully lullay.

O sisters too,
how may we do
for to preserve this day
this poor youngling,
for whom we do sing
by by, lully lullay?

Lully, lulla,
thou little tiny child,
by by, lully lullay.

Herod the king,
in his raging,
charged he hath this day
his men of might,
in his own sight,
all young children to slay.

Lully, lulla,
thou little tiny child,
by by, lully lullay.

That woe is me,
poor child for thee!
and ever morn and day,
for thy parting
neither say nor sing
by by, lully lullay!

Lully, lulla,
thou little tiny child,
by by, lully lullay.
