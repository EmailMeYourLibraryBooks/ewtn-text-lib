# Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness

***

## Setting: The Hymnal 1982 339

Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,
leave the gloomy haunts of sadness,
come into the daylight’s splendor,
there with joy thy praises render
unto him whose grace unbounded
hath this wondrous banquet founded;
high o’er all the heavens he reigneth,
yet to dwell with thee he deigneth.

Sun, who all my life dost brighten;
Light, who dost my soul enlighten;
Joy, the best that any knoweth;
Fount, whence all my being floweth:
at thy feet I cry, my Maker,
let me be a fit partaker
of this blessed food from heaven,
for our good, thy glory, given.

Jesus, Bread of life, I pray thee,
let me gladly here obey thee;
never to my hurt invited,
be thy love with love requited;
from this banquet let me measure,
Lord, how vast and deep its treasure;
through the gifts thou here dost give me,
as thy guest in heaven receive me.

## Setting: Handel/Crüger

Deck thyself, my soul, with gladness,
Dwell no more in gloom and sadness;
Jesu, Bread of life, most holy,
Bows to dwell with thee most lowly.
Hasten now, my soul, to meet him;
Here with loving reverence greet him
Who with words of life immortal,
Stands before thy spirit's portal.

Jesu, Joy beyond all measure,
Truest friend, thou priceless treasure;
Gentle One, who here invites me,
Who as God with God unites me.
Here I humbly kneel before thee,
My Salvation, I adore thee.
Worthy, let me now receive thee,
Steadfast, let me never leave thee.
