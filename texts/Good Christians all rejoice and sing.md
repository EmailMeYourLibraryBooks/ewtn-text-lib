## AH.419

Good Christian men, rejoice and sing!  
Now is the triumph of our King:  
To all the world glad news we bring:  
Alleluia!  

The Lord of Life is risen for aye:  
Bring flowers of song to strew his way;  
Let all mankind rejoice and say:  
Alleluia!  

Praise we in songs of victory  
That Love, that Life, which cannot die,  
And sing with hearts uplifted high:  
Alleluia!  

Thy name we bless, O risen Lord,  
And sing today with one accord  
The life laid down, the life restored:  
Alleluia!
