# Rejoice, the Lord is king

***

## Setting: Worship 4th Edition 564

Rejoice, the Lord is King!
Your Lord and King adore!
Rejoice, give thanks, and sing,
And triumph evermore.

Refrain:
Lift up your heart,
lift up your voice!
Rejoice, again I say, rejoice!

The Lord, our Savior, reigns,
The God of truth and love.
When he had purged our sins,
He took his seat above.

His kingdom cannot fail,
He rules o'er earth and heav'n.
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus giv'n.

Rejoice in glorious hope!
For Christ the Judge shall come
And take his servants up
To their eternal home.
