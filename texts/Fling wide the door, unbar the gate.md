# Fling wide the door, unbar the gate

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 32

Fling wide the door, unbar the gate;
The King of glory comes in state;
The Lord of lords and King of kings,
The Savior of the world who brings 
His great salvation to the earth.
So raise a shout of holy mirth
And praise our God and Lord,
Creator, Spirit, Word.

He is the rock of our belief,
The heart of mercy’s gentle self.
His kingly crown is holiness; 
His scepter is his loveliness;
He brings our sorrows to an end.
Now gladly praise our king and friend,
And worship him with song
For saving us from wrong.

O, happy towns and blessed lands
That live by their true king’s commands.
And blessed be the hearts he rules,
The humble places where he dwells.
He is the rightful Son of bliss
Who fills our lives and makes us his,
Creator of the world,
Our only strength for good.

Come, Lord, our Savior, Jesus Christ;
Our hearts are open wide in trust.
Oh, show us now your lovely grace,
Upon our sorrows shine your face,
And let your Holy Spirit guide
Our journey in your grace so wide.
We praise your holy name,
From age to age the same!
