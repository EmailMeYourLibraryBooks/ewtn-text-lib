# Praise the Lord, rise up, rejoicing

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 196

Praise the Lord, rise up rejoicing,
Worship, thanks, devotion voicing:
Glory be to God on high!
Christ, your cross and Passion sharing,
By the Eucharist declaring
Yours the final victory.

Scattered flock, one shepherd sharing,
Lost and lonely, one voice hearing,
Ears attentive to your word;
By your blood new life receiving, 
In your body, firm believing, 
We are yours, and you the Lord.

Sins forgiven, wrongs forgiving,
We go forth alert and living
In your spirit, strong and free.
Partners in your new creation,
Seeking peace in every nation,
May we faithful followers be.
