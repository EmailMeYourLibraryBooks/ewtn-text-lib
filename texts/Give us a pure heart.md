# Give us a pure heart

***

## Setting: Christopher Willcock

Give us a pure heart, that we may see you;
Give us a humble heart that we may hear you;
Give us a heart of love that we may serve you;
Give us a heart of faith that we may live in you,
That we may live in you.
 
Give us a pure heart, that we may see you;
Give us a humble heart that we may hear you;
Give us a heart of love that we may serve you;
Give us a heart of faith that we may live in you,
That we may live in you.
