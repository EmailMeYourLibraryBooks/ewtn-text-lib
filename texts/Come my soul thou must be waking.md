# Come, my soul, thou must be waking

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Haydn)

Come, my soul, thou must be waking;
now is breaking o'er the earth another day:
come to him who made this splendor;
see thou render all thy feeble pow'rs can pay.

Thou too hail the light returning;
ready burning be the incense of thy pow'rs;
for the night is safely ended,
God hath tended with his care thy helpless hours.

Pray that he may prosper ever
each endeavor, when thine aim is good and true;
but that he may ever thwart thee,
and convert thee, when thou evil wouldst pursue.

Think that he thy ways beholdeth;
he unfoldeth ev'ry fault that lurks within;
every stain of shame glossed over
can discover, and discern each deed of sin.

Only God's free gifts abuse not,
light refuse not, but his Spirit's voice obey;
thou with him shalt dwell, beholding
light enfolding all things in unclouded day.
