# There is no rose of such virtue

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu,
Alleluia.

For in this rose contained was
Heaven and earth in little space,
Res miranda.

By that rose we may well see
That he is God in persons three,
Pari forma. 

There is no rose of such virtue
As is the rose that bare Jesu,
Alleluia.
