# How oft, O Lord, thy face hath shown

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

How oft, O Lord thy face hath shown
on doubting souls whose wills were true!
Thou Chtist of Peter and of John,
thou art the Christ of Thomas too.

He loved thee well, and firmly said,
"Come, let us go, and die with him;"
yet when thine Easter news was spread,
mid all its light his faith was dim.

His brethren's word he would not take,
but craved to touch those hands of thine;
when thou didst thine appearance make,
he saw, and hailed his Lord Divine.

He saw thee risen: at once he rose
to full belief's unclouded height;
and still through his confession flows
to Christian souls thy life and light.

O Savior, make thy presence known
to all who doubt thy Word and thee;
and teach us in that Word alone
to find the truth that sets us free.
