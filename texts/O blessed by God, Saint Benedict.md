# O blessed by God, Saint Benedict

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

O blessed by God, Saint Benedict,
Let sadness not our hearts afflict,
As we our yearly tribute bring,
Thy saintly life and glories sing.

Saint Benedict, to thee we turn,
The secrets of God’s grace to learn,
Oh, guide us by thy wise decrees
That God alone we seek to please.

In wondrous ray of God’s own light
The world appeared before thy sight;
Then thou the emptiness didst see
Of earthly things whate’er they be.

Praise, honor, glory be to thee,
Most blessed, holy Trinity,
Thy love unbounded didst impart
Unto our Saint’s enraptured heart.
