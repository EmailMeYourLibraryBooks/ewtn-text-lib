# Jesus, my dreadful leprosy

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Jesus, my dreadful leprosy
oppresses me with grief;
here at thy feet, I prostrate fall
for pity and relief.

I am unholy and unclean,
apply thy grace to me;
for thou art able, if thou wilt,
to heal my leprosy.

Compassion moves his tender heart
And, with a gracious word,
He speaks, “I will,” and with a touch
the leprous soul restored.

Ye leprous souls, to Jesus come,
With sin, a worse disease:
tis he can heal your maladies,
And give your conscience ease.

He can, by his almighty grace,
Heal each poor leprous soul;
Come, guilty, filthy, as you are,
and he will make you whole.
