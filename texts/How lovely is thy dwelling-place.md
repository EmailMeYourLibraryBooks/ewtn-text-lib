# How lovely is thy dwelling-place

***

## Setting: The Hymnal 1982 517

How lovely is thy dwelling-place,
O Lord of hosts, to me!
My thirsty soul desires and longs
within thy courts to be;
my very heart and flesh cry out,
O living God, for thee.

Beside thine altars, gracious Lord,
the swallows find a nest;
how happy they who dwell with thee
and praise thee without rest,
and happy they whose hearts are set
upon the pilgrim’s quest.

They who go through the desert vale
will find it filled with springs,
and they shall climb from height to height
till Zion’s temple rings
with praise to thee, in glory throned,
Lord God, great King of kings.

One day within thy courts excels
a thousand spent away;
how happy they who keep thy laws
nor from thy precepts stray,
from thou shalt surely bless all those
who live the words they pray.
