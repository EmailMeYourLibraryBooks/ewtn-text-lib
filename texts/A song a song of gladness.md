# A song, a song of gladness

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

A song, a song of gladness!  
A song of thanks and praise!  
The horn of our salvation  
Hath GOD vouchsafed to raise!  
A monarch true and faithful,  
And glorious in her might,  
To champion Christ's own quarrel,  
And Orthodoxy’s right!  

Now manifest is glory;  
Now grace and virtue shine:  
Now joys the Church regaining  
Her ornaments divine:  
And girds them on in gladness,  
As fits a festal day,  
After long months of struggle,  
Long years of disarray.  

Sing, sing for joy, each desert!  
Exult, each realm of earth!  
Ye mountains, drop down sweetness!  
Ye hillocks, leap for mirth!  
For Christ the Word, bestowing  
His blessed peace on men,  
In Faith’s most holy union  
Hath knit His Church again.  

O LORD of loving kindness,  
How wondrous are Thy ways!  
What tongue of man suffices  
Thy gentleness to praise?  
Because of Thy dear Image  
Men dared Thy Saints to kill,  
Yet didst Thou not consume them,  
But bear’st their insults still.  

hou Who has fixed unshaken  
Thy Church’s mighty frame,  
So that hell-gates shall never  
Prevail against the same;—  
Bestow upon Thy people  
Thy peace, that we may bring  
One voice, one hymn, one spirit,  
To glorify our King!
