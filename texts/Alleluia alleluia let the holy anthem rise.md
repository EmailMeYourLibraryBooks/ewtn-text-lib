# Alleluia! alleluia! let the holy anthem rise

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 266

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Let the holy anthem rise,
And the choirs of heaven chant it
In the temple of the skies;
Let the mountains skip with gladness,
And the joyful valleys ring
With hosannas in the highest
To our Savior and our King!

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Like the sun from out the wave,
He has risen up in triumph
From the darkness of the grave.
He's the splendor of the nations,
He's the lamp of endless day;
He's the very Lord of glory
Who is risen up today!

Alleluia! Alleluia!
Blessed Jesus, make us rise
From the life of this corruption
To the life that never dies.
May your glory be our portion
When the days of time are past
And the dead shall be awakened
By the trumpet's mighty blast!
