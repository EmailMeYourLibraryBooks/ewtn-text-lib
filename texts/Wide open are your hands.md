# Wide open are your hands

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 489

Wide open are your hands
To pay with more than gold
The awful debt of guilt and sin,
Forever and of old.
Ah, let me grasp those hands,
That we may never part,
And let the power of their blood
Sustain my fainting heart.

Wide open are your arms,
A fallen world to embrace,
To win to love and endless rest
Our wayward human race.
Lord, I am sad and poor,
But boundless is your grace;
Give me the soul-transforming joy
For which I seek your face.

Draw all my mind and heart
Up to your throne on high,
And let your sacred cross exalt
My spirit to the sky.
To these, your mighty hands,
My spirit I resign.
In life, I live alone to you;
In death, am yours alone.
