# Silence! frenzied, unclean spirit

***

# Setting: Banks (TON-Y-BOTEL)

“Silence! frenzied, unclean spirit,”
Cried God’s healing, holy one.
“Cease your ranting! flesh can’t bear it.
Flee as night before the sun.”
At Christ’s voice the demon trembled,
From its victim madly rushed,
While the crowd that was assembled
Stood in wonder, stunned and hushed.

Silence, Lord, the unclean spirit,
In our mind and in our heart.
Speak your word that, when we hear it,
All our demons shall depart.
Clear our thought and calm our feeling,
Still the fractured, warring woul.
By the power of your healing
Make us faithful, true, and whole.
