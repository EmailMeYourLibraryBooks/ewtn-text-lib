# At the Lamb's high feast we sing

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 411

At the Lamb's high feast we sing
Praise to our victorious King:
Who hath washed us in the tide
Flowing from his pierc√®d side;
Praise we him whose love divine
Gives the guests his blood for wine,
Gives his body for the feast,
Love the Victim, Love the Priest.

Where the Paschal blood is poured,
Death's dark angel sheathes his sword;
Israel's hosts triumphant go
Through the wave that drowns the foe.
Christ, the Lamb whose blood was shed,
Paschal victim, Paschal bread!
With sincerity and love
Eat we Manna from above.

Mighty Victim from on high,
Powers of hell beneath thee lie;
Death is broken in the fight,
Thou hast brought us life and light.
Now thy banner thou dost wave,
Conquering Satan and the grave.
See the prince of darkness quelled;
Heaven's bright gates are open held.

Paschal triumph, Paschal joy,
Only sin can this destroy;
From sin's death do thou set free,
Souls re-born, dear Lord, in thee.
Hymns of glory, songs of praise,
Father, unto thee we raise.
Risen Lord, all praise to thee,
Ever with the Spirit be.
