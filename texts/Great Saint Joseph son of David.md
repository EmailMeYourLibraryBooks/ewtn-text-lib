# Great Saint Joseph, Son of David

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Great Saint Joseph! Son of David,
Foster father of our Lord,
Spouse of mary ever-virgin,
keeping over them watch and ward!
In the stable thou didst guard them,
with a father’s loving care;
Thou by God’s command didst save them
from the cruel Herod’s snare.

Three long days in grief and anguish
with his mother sweet and mild,
Mary, Virgin, didst thou wander
seeking the beloved Child.
In the temple thou didst find him:
Oh! what joy then filled thy heart!
In thy sorrows, in thy gladness,
grant us, Joseph, to have part.

Clasped in Jesus’ arms and Mary’s,
when death gently came at last,
Thy pure spirit sweetly sighing from its earthly dwelling passed.
Dear Saint Joseph, by thy passing,
may our death be like to thine;
And with Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
May our souls forever shine.
