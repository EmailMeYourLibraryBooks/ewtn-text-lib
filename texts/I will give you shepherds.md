# I will give you shepherds

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

I will give you shepherds
according my own heart,
which shall feed you
with knowledge and understanding.
I will give you shepherds
according my own heart,
which shall feed you
with knowledge and understanding.

Like a shepherd feeds his flock
and gathers lambs in his arms,
he holds them close to his heart,
leading them home.

I will give you shepherds
according my own heart,
which shall feed you
with knowledge and understanding.

I am the Good Shepherd,
I know my own and they know me,
as the Father knows me and I know the Father;
I lay down my life for the sheep.

I will give you shepherds
according my own heart,
which shall feed you
with knowledge and understanding.
I will give you shepherds
according my own heart,
which shall feed you
with knowledge and understanding.

## Setting: Gregory K. Evans

I will give you shepherds
after my own heart,
And shall feed you
with knowledge, on knowledge,
and true doctrine.

I will feed my sheep;
I will look for the lost oneâ€”
Bring back the stray.

I will give you shepherds
after my own heart,
And shall feed you
with knowledge, on knowledge,
and true doctrine.

Praise, O servants of the Lord,
Praise the name of the Lord.

I will give you shepherds
after my own heart,
And shall feed you
with knowledge, on knowledge,
and true doctrine.
