# This is my will, my one command

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 480

This is my will, my one command,
That love should dwell among you all.
This is my will, that you should love
As I have shown that I love you.

No greater love that one can have,
Than that one die to save one’s friends.
You are my friends if you obey
WhatI command that you should do.

I call you now no longer slaves;
No slave knows all the master does.
I call you friends for all I hear
My Father say, you hear from me.

You chose not me, but I chose you.
That you should go and bear much fruit.
I chose you out that you in me
Should bear much fruit that will abide.

All that you ask my Father dear,
For my name’s sake you shall receive.
This is my will, my one command,
That love should dwell in each, in all.
