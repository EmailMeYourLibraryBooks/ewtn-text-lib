# We come as those who serve

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

We come as those who serve,
sent by the Father in the Spirit of love.
In Christ we come,
In Christ we come as those who serve.

The Lord in lowly power
put down the mighty from their thrones;
that we in direst hour,
might feel new life in tired bones.

We come as those who serve,
sent by the Father in the Spirit of love.
In Christ we come,
In Christ we come as those who serve.

He said, "The meek shall conquer,
the weak shall rule the strong with love."
So we as servants honor
the Lord who bears a cross above.

We come as those who serve,
sent by the Father in the Spirit of love.
In Christ we come,
In Christ we come as those who serve.

For we, baptized in water,
a Gospel to the world proclaim;
made sure, who fail and falter,
to rise in Christ and bear his name!

We come as those who serve,
sent by the Father in the Spirit of love.
In Christ we come,
In Christ we come as those who serve.
