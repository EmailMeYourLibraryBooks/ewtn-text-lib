## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 310

 Ave, Mary, full of grace
in whose virgin arms’ embrace
God to God himself doth vow:
Alleluia, allleuia!
Let me in the temple wait,
Jesu, for mine all art thou.

God is to his temple come;
Angels throng the hallowed dome:
What beyond hath heaven in store?
Alleluia, alleluia!
God himself our flesh doth wear;
This than heaven itself is more.

Incensegales of gladness rise
Where this morning sacrifice
‘Mid re-echoing shouts is made:
Alleluia, alleluia!
Evening’s rite in tears shall end,
On the darkening cross displayed.

There behold the Oblation wrought,
By whose precious ransom bought,
We are all to God made nigh:
Alleluia, alleluia!
Now no longer, Lord, our own,
Thine we live and thine we die.

Let thy servants now depart;
May we see thee as thou art;
Nought of earth arrest our eye!
Alleluia, alleluia!
Let us here with Jesus grow,
And in him hereafter rise.
