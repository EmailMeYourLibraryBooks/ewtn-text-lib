# O praise ye the Lord

***

## Setting: Parry, arr. Thaxton

O praise ye the Lord, and sing a new song,
amid all his saints his praises prolong.
The praise of their Maker his people shall sing,
and children of Zion rejoice in their King.

With timbrel and harp and joyful acclaim,
with gladness and mirth, sing praise to his name;
for God in his people his pleasure doth seek,
with robes of salvation he clotheth the meek.

In glory exult, ye saints of the Lord;
with songs in the night high praises accord.
Go forth in his service and strong in his might
to conquer all evil and stand for the right.

For this is his word: his saints shall not fail,
but over the earth their pow'r shall prevail.
All kingdoms and nations shall yield to their sway.
To God give the glory and praise him for aye.
