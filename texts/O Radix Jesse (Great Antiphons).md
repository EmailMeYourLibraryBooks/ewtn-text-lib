# O Radix Jesse (Great Antiphons)

***

## Setting: Traditional Plainchant

O Radix Jesse,
qui stas in signum populorum, 
super quem continebunt reges ossuum,
quem gentes deprecabuntur:
Veni ad liberandum nos,
iam noli tardare.

O Root of Jesse, 
who stands as a sign to the peoples, 
before whom kings are mute,
to whom all nations shall appeal:
Come to deliver us;
delay, please, no longer.
