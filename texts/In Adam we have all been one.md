# In Adam we have all been one

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

In Adam we have all been one,
One huge rebellious man;
We all have fled that Evening Voice
That sought us as we ran.

We fled thee, and in losing thee
We lost our brother too;
Each singly sought and claimed his own;
Each man his brother slew.

But thy strong love, it sought us still
And sent thine only Son
That we might hear his shepherdâ€™s voice
And, hearing him, be one.
