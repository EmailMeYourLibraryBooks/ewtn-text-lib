# Hail Mary, queen and virgin pure

***

# Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Hail! Mary, queen and virgin pure,
with every grace replete;
Hail! kind protectress of the poor,
Do pity our seedy state.

O thou who fillest highest place,
Next heavens imperial throne,
Obtain for us each saving grace, 
And make our wants thine own.

How oft, when trouble filled my breast,
Or sin my conscience pained,
Through thee I sought for peace and rest,
Through thee I peace obtained.

Then hence, in all my pains and cares,
I’ll seek for help in thee,
E’er trusting, through thy powerful prayers,
To gain eternity.
