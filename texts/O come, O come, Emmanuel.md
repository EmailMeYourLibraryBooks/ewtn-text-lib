# O come, O come, Emmanuel

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 301

O come, O come, Emmanuel,
And ransom captive Israel,
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, of all the nations King,
The world awaits ransoming;
Remove our hate and faithlessness,
Unite us who thy Name confess.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, thou Dayspring, come and cheer
Our spirits by thine advent here;
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night,
And death’s dark shadows put to flight.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, thou Key of David, come, 
And open wide our heavenly home;
Make safe the way that leads on high,
And close the path of misery.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, thou Rod of Jesse, free 
Thine own from Satan's tyranny;
From depths of hell thy people save 
And give them vict'ry o'er the grave.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, O come, thou Lord of Might,
Who to thy tribes, on Sinai’s height,
In ancient times didst give the law
In cloud, and majesty, and awe.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.

O come, thou Wisdom born in heaven's height, 
Come peacefully, thy peoples set aright, 
To us the path of knowledge show, 
And help us in that way to go.
Rejoice, rejoice!
Emmanuel shall come to thee, O Israel.
