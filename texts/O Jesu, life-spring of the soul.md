# O Jesu, life-spring of the soul

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (HIDING PLACE)

O Jesu, Life-spring of the soul,
The Father’s power and glory bright.
Thee with the angels we extoll;
From thee they draw their life and light.

Thy thousand, thousand hosts are spread
Embattled o’er the azure sky,
But Michael bears thy standard dread
And lifts the mighty Cross on high.

He in that sign the rebel powers
Did with their dragon prince expel,
And hurled them from the heavens high towers
Down like a Thunderbolt to hell.

Grant us with Michael still, O Lord, 
Against the prince of pride to fight;
So may a crown be our reward
Before the Lamb’s pure throne of light.

To God the Father, with the Son
And Holy Paraclete, with thee,
As evermore hath been before,
Be glory through eternity.
