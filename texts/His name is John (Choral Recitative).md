# His name is John (Choral Recitative)

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

And on the eighth day 
they came to circumcise the child;
And they would have called him Zecharaiah
after his father;
But his mother Elizabeth answered:
“No, he shall be called John.”

And they said to her:
“None of your relatives is called by this name.”
And they made signs to his father,
asking what he wanted him to be called.
So Zecharaiah asked for a writing tablet,
and he wrote: “His name is John.”
And his tongue was loosed,
and he spoke, blessing God!
