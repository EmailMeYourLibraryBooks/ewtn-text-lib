# Simon, Simon, do you love me

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do, then feed my lambs.
Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do then feed my sheep.
Show me that my love had moved you.
Imitate how I have loved you.
Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do then feed my sheep.

Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do, then feed my lambs.
Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do then feed my sheep.
Show me that my love had moved you.
Imitate how I have loved you.
Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do then feed my sheep.

Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do, then feed my lambs.
Simon, Simon, do you love me?
If you do then feed my sheep.
Ponder why I called and trained you,
named you Peter, ordained you my Rock.
do you love me, truly love me?
If you do then feed my flock.
