Mary the Dawn, Christ the Perfect Day;
Mary the Gate, Christ the Heavenly way!

Mary the Root, Christ the Mystic Vine;
Mary the Grape, Chris the Sacred Wine!

Mary the Wheatsheaf, Chris the Living Bread;
Mary the Rose-Tree, Christ the Rose blood-red!

Mary the Font, Christ the Cleansing Flood;
Mary the Chalice, Christ the God adored!

Mary the Temple, Christ the Temple’s Lord;
Mary the Shrine, Christ the God Adored!

Mary the Beacon, Christ the Haven’s Rest;
Mary the Mirror, Christ the Vision Blest!

Mary the Mother, Christ the Mother’s Son;
Both ever blest while endless ages run. Amen.
