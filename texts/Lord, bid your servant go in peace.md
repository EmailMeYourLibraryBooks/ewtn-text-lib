# Lord, bid your servant go in peace

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 439

Lord, bid your servant go in peace.
Your word is now fulfilled. 
These eyes have seen salvation’s dawn,
This child so long foretold.

This is the Savior of the world,
The Gentiles promised light,
God’s glory dwelling in our midst,
The joy of Israel.

This child shall see the rise, the fall,
Of those in Israel,
God’s sign raised high for all to see,
Whom some shall yet deny.

His mother’s soul a sword shall pierce,
Of sorrow keen and deep:
And secret thoughts of many hearts
Through him shall be revealed.

Blest be the Father, who has given
His Son to be our Lord;
Blest, too, that Son, and with them both
The Spirit of their love.
