# Wash us, Jesus, in thy blood

***

## Setting: Bach, arr. Thaxton

Wash us, Jesus! in Thy blood,
From the sinstain of our nature,
Let us rise from out this flood
Clothed in Thee, a newborn creature;
May we, washed as Thou hast bidden,
In thine innocence be hidden.

Turn the darkness into light,
Change Thy wrath to gracious favor,
Heal the serpent’s cruel bite,
By this wonder-working laver;
Here let flow a Jordan river,
And from leprosy deliver.

This assurance, night and morn,
In our ears re-echoes ever,
Who are not of water born
And the spirit, pure are never, 
Ne’er can claim the Savior’s merit, 
Ne’er his kingdom shall inherit.
