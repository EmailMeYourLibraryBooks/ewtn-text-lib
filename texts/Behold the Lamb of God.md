# Behold the Lamb of God

***

## Setting: Healey Willan

Behold the Lamb of God,
Which taketh away the sin of the world.
Surely he hath borne our griefs
And carried our sorrows.
He was sounded for our transgressions,
He was bruised for our iniquities.
Behold the Lamb of God,
Which taketh away the sin of the world.
