God rest you merry, gentlemen,  
let nothing you dismay,  
Remember Christ our Savior  
was born on Christmas Day;  
To save us all from Satan’s power  
When we were gone astray.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy,  
O tidings of comfort and joy!  

From God our heavenly Father  
A blessed angel came;  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same;  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy,  
O tidings of comfort and joy!  

“Fear not, then,” said the angel,  
“Let nothing you affright;  
This day is born a Savior  
Of a pure virgin bright,  
To free all hose who trust in him  
From Satan’s power and might.”  
O tidings of comfort and joy,   
comfort and joy,  
O tidings of comfort and joy!  

Now to the Lord sing praises,  
All you within this place,  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace;  
This holy tide of Christmas  
Doth bring redeeming grace.  
O tidings of comfort and joy,  
comfort and joy,  
O tidings of comfort and joy!
