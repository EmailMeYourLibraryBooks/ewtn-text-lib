# What shall I render

***

## Setting: Deborah Garcia

What shall I render to the Lord
For all the good He has done for me?

I will lift up the cup of salvation
And call upon the name of the Lord.

What shall I render to the Lord
For all the good He has done for me?

I will pay my vows to the Lord,
In the presence of his people.

What shall I render to the Lord
For all the good He has done for me?

I will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving,
And call upon the name of the Lord.

What shall I render to the Lord
For all the good He has done for me?

I will pay my vows in the courts of the Lord,
In your midst, O Jerusalem.

What shall I render to the Lord
For all the good He has done for me?
