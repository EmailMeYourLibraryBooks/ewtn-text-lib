# My Prayer

***

## Setting: Franz Abt

Lord, make me pure within,
And take away my sin;
The vict’ry, vict’ry I would win
o’er ev’ry, ev’ry foe.
Lord, live Thy life, Thy life in me,
Lest I, lest I dishonor Thee,
And may I ever be,
And may I ever be Thine,
Wholly Thine, Thine, wholly Thine.

Lord, cleanse my heart, I pray,
Wash all my sins away,
And may, and may I from this day
Be Thine, be Thine alone.
Lord, live Thy life, Thy life in me,
Lest I, lest I dishonor Thee,
And may I ever be,
And may I ever be Thine,
Wholly Thine, Thine, wholly Thine.

Lord, hear my feeble cry,
For sin is ever nigh,
And lest, and lest I faint and die
Be Thou, be Thou my stay.
Lord, live Thy life, Thy life in me,
Lest I, lest I dishonor Thee,
And may I ever be,
And may I ever be Thine,
Wholly Thine, Thine, wholly Thine.

Lord, Thou hast heard my prayer,
And all my sin and care I know,
I know that Thou dost bear, 
For Thou, for Thou art mine.
Lord, live Thy life, Thy life in me,
Lest I, lest I dishonor Thee,
And may I ever be,
And may I ever be Thine,
Wholly Thine, Thine, wholly Thine.
