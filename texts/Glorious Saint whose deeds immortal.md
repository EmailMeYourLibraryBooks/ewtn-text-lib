# Glorious Saint, whose deeds immortal

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Glorious Saint, whose deeds immortal
We extoll and magnify,
Radiant star, whose rising splendor
Set ablaze the orient sky;
Oh, how bright today thy shining
'Midst the saints of God on high!

Beautiful whose feet that carried
News of God's redemptive plan,
Crossing lands and furthest oceans,
Bringing peace to fallen man,
Herald who with torch uplifted
Realms of darkness overran.

Great thy labors in the vineyard,
Great the harvest gathered in,
Greater still thy soul's ambition
Further continents to win;
But God willed thy greatest conquests
Should henceforth in heaven begin.

Father, may we share thy triumphs,
Join thee henceforth in the fight,
May our lives be flaming torches,
Pure and holy, burning bright,
Driving hence the powers of darkness,
Leading to eternal light.
