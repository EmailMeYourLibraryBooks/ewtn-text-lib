# O Mother, most afflicted

***

## Setting: Gregory Evans

O Mother! Most afflicted,
Standing beneath that tree,
Where Jesus hangs rejected
On the hill of Calvary!

O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.

Thy heart is well-nigh breaking,
Thy Jesus thus to see,
Derided, wounded, dying,
In greatest agony.

O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.

His livid Form is bleeding,
His Soul with sorrow wrung,
Whilst thou, afflicted Mother,
Shar'st the torments of thy Son.

O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.

O Mary! Queen of Martyrs,
The sword had pierced thy heart,
Obtain for us of Jesus
In thy grief to bear apart.

O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.

O dear and loving Mother!
Entreat that we may be
Near thee and thy dear Jesus
Now and eternally.

O Mary! sweetest Mother,
We love to pity thee;
O! for the sake of Jesus
Let us thy children be.
