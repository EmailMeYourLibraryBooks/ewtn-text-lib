# O Son of God in Galilee

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 426

O Son of God, in Galilee
You made the deaf to hear,
The mute to speak, the blind to see;
O blessed Lord, be near.

Oh, listen to the silent prayer
Of your afflicted ones.
Oh, bid them cast on you their care;
Your grace to them make known.

The speechless tongue, the lifeless ear
You can restore, O Lord;
Your “Ephphatha,” O Savior dear,
Can instant help afford.

Meanwhile to them the list’ning ear
Of steadfast faith impart,
And let your word bring light and cheer
To ev’ry troubled heart.

Then in your promised happy land
Each loss will prove a gain;
All myst’ries we shall understand.
For you will make them plain.
