# Speak now, O Lord, your servant hears

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Speak now, O Lord, your servant hears,
And I will answer your call;
Speak in your still, small voice of calm,
As now I give you my all.
O teach me, Lord, that I may teach 
the precious truths that you impart,
And wing my words that they may reach
the hidden depths of many a heart.

Lord, speak to me that I may speak
In living echoes of your tone.
As you have sought, so let me seek
You erring servants, lost and lone.
O lead me, Lord, that I may lead 
the wand'ring and the wav'ring feet.
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed 
Your hungry ones with manna sweet.

O fill me with your fullness, Lord, 
Until my very heart o'erflows
In kindling thought and glowing word,
your love to tell, your praise to show.
O, use me, Lord, your servant be,
Just as you will, and when, and where,
Until your blessed face I see, 
Your rest, your joy, your glory share. Amen.
