# Lord, for thy tender mercy's sake

***

## Setting: Richard Farrant

Lord, for thy tender mercy's sake,
lay not our sins to our charge,
but forgive that is past,
and give us grace to amend our sinful lives.
To decline from sin and incline to virtue,
that we may walk in a perfect heart 
before thee,
now and evermore,
that we may walk in a perfect heart 
before thee,
now and evermore,
Amen.
