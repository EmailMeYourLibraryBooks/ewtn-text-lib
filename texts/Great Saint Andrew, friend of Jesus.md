# Great Saint Andrew, friend of Jesus

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (IN BABILONE)

Great Saint Andrew, friend of Jesus,
Lover of his glorious cross,
Quickly, at the Master's bidding,
Called from ease to pain and loss;
Strong Saint Andrew, Simon's brother, 
Like him started life anew,
Gladly spread the holy gospel
Which from Word of God he drew.

Blest Saint Andrew noble herald,
True apostle, martyr bold,
Who by deeds his words confirming,
Sealed with blood the truth he told.
Never was a crown more glorious,
Never prize to heart so dear,
As to him the cross of Jesus
When its promised joys drew near.
