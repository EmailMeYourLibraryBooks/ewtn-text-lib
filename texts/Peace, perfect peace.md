# Peace, perfect peace

***

## Setting: Gibbons

Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The Blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus, this is rest.

Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
In Jesus’ arms will nought but calm be found.

Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus’ keeping we are safe, and they.
