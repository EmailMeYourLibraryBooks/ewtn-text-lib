# God bless our native land

***

## Setting: Hymnal 1982 716

God bless our native land;
firm may she ever stand
through storm and night:
when the wild tempests rave,
ruler of wind and wave,
do thou our country save
by thy great might.

For her our prayers shall rise
to God, above the skies;
on him we wait;
thou who art ever nigh,
guarding with watchful eye,
to thee aloud we cry,
God save the state!
