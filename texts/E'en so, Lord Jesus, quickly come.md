# E'en so, Lord Jesus, quickly come

***

## Setting: Paul Manz

Peace be to you and grace from him
Who freed us from our sins,
Who loved us all and shed his blood
That we might saved be.

Sing Holy, Holy to our Lord,
The Lord, Almighty God,
Who was, and is, and is to come;
Sing Holy, Holy Lord!
Rejoice in heaven, all ye that dwell therein,
Rejoice on earth, ye saints below,
For Christ is coming, is coming soon,
For Christ is coming soon.

E'en so Lord Jesus, quickly come
And night shall be no more;
They need no light nor lamp nor sun,
For Christ will be their All!
