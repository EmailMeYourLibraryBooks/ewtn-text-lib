# Myrrh-bearing Mary

***

## Setting: Together in Song 660

Myrrh-bearing Mary from Magdala came 
seeking her Jesus, with spirit aflame;
he had commanded her sickness depart;
she now would thank him for newness of heart.

Myrrh-bearing Mary to Bethany came
seeking her Jesus who’d called her by name; 
there she anointed his feet and his head
with precious oils that were meant for the dead.

Myrrh-bearing Mary to Calvary came
seeking her Jesus who hung there in shame; 
and as the careless and heedless passed by, 
hopeless and helpless she watched her Lord die.

Myrrh-bearing Mary to death’s garden came
seeking her Jesus who’d borne the world’s blame; 
heart-sick she stood, till she heard the Lord’s voice: 
“Mary!”he said,“I am risen; rejoice!”
