# Angels we have heard on high

***

## AH.323 GLORIA

Angels we have heard on high,  
sweetly singing o'er the plains,  
and the mountains in reply  
echoing their joyous strains:  

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  

Shepherds, why this jubilee?  
Why your joyous strains prolong?  
Say what may the tidings be  
Which inspire your heavenly song?  

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  

Come to Bethlehem and see  
Him whose birth the angels sing;  
come, adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord, the new-born King.  

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  

See him in a manger laid,  
Whom the choirs of angels praise;  
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid,  
While our hearts in love we raise.  

Gloria, in excelsis Deo!  
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
