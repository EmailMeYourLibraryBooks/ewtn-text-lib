# A New Commandment

***

## Gregory Evans

A new commandment I give to you,  
a new commandment I give to you:  
that you love each other,  
that you love each other,  
even as I have loved you.  

By this all men will know,  
by this all men will know,  
that you are my disciples,  
that you are my disciples,  
if you have love for each other.
