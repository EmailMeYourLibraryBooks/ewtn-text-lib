# When the stone had been sealed

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

When the stone had been sealed by the Jews,
While the soldiers were guarding thy most pure body
Thou didst rise on the third day, O Savior,
Granting life to the world.
The powers of heaven therefore cried to thee, O Giver of life:
Glory to thy resurrection, O Christ!
Glory to thy kingdom!
Glory to thy dispensation,
O thou who loves mankind!
