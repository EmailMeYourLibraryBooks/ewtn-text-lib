# Blessed Pius X

***

## Setting: Pius X Hymnal 120

A humble priest on Peter’s throne
With all the world to win,
You made your children’s cares your own;
You sorrowed for their sin.
You gave them God’s Son sacrificed
To make them new in Christ.
O Blessed Pius, make anew
All things in Christ who lived in you.

You gave to men Christ’s Blood poured out,
Gave children stron men’s Bread.
You took from men all feaer and doubt
And gave them truth instead:
The truth that God’s Son sacrificed
Would make them new in Christ.
O Blessed Pius, make anew
All things in Christ who lived in you.

You bade the priests who were your sons
Be strong in heart and mind,
To cherish all God’s little ones
With love both wise and kind.
You taught them love alone sufficed
To make them new in Christ.
O Blessed Pius, make anew
All things in Christ who lived in you.

You taught us how to shape our song,
Our cry to God for grace.
Now Holy Father, make us strong
And lead us to that place
Where now with God’s Son sacrificed
You live anew in Christ.
O Blessed Pius, make anew
All things in Christ who lived in you.
