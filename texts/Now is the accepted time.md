# Now is the accepted time

Now is the accepted time,
Now is the day of grace;
O sinners! come, without delay,
And seek the Saviour's face.

Now is the accepted time,
The Saviour calls to-day;
To-morrow it may be too late;
Then why should you delay?

Now is the accepted time,
The gospel bids you come;
And every promise in his word
Declares there yet is room.

Lord, draw reluctant souls,
And feast them with thy love;
Then will the angels spread their wings,
And bear the news above.
