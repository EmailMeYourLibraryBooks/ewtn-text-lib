# O Heart of Jesus, Heart of God

***

## Setting: Theodore Marier

O Heart of Jesus, Heart of God,
O source of boundless love,
By angels praised, by saints adored
From their bright thrones above.
The poorest, saddest heart on earth
May claim thee for its own;
O birning, throbbing Heart of Christ,
Thou art too little known.
 
The world is cold and life is sad,
I crave the blessed rest
Of those who lay their weary heads
Upon thy sacred breast.
The purest, deepest earthly love,
What is it, Lord, to Thine?
Oh! grant a spark of that great fire
To this cold heart of mine.
