# As Joseph Lay Uneasy

## CVH.172

As Joseph lay uneasy, 
Sore troubled and distressed,  
There came an angel-message  
To soothe his sad unrest,  
There came an angel-message  
To soothe his sad unrest.  

“Fear not, O son of David,  
To take your gentle bride:  
This Child of hers is holy,  
Conceived of God most high.  
This Child of hers is holy,  
Conceived of God most high.”  

“His Name it shall be Jesus,  
The Name you’ll give to Him;  
For thus it has been written,  
He’ll save the world from sin.  
For thus it has been written,  
He’ll save the world from sin.”  

“Isaiah had foretold it:  
‘A maid shall bear a Son,  
Emmanuel, God with us’  
And thus it has been done.  
‘Emmanuel, God with us’  
And thus it has been done.  

Then Joseph rose from slumber  
And took his holy bride;  
Her babe, he named it Jesus  
At blessed Christmastide.  
Her babe, he named it Jesus  
At blessed Christmastide.
