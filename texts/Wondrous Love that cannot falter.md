# Wondrous Love that cannot falter

***

## Setting: St. Gregory Hymnal 56 (Gounod)

Wondrous love that cannot falter!
Jesus in the Host doth dwell
Day and night upon the Altar
Near to those He loves so well.
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!

Angel hosts are hushed in wonder
And adore with folded wings:
For the lowly Species under,
Hidden lies the King of Kings.
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!

Tho' the Heavenly choir rejoices
Praise to singâ€“his loving ear
Seeks the tribute of our voices:
'Tis for us he waiteth here!
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!

All he hath in highest Heaven
Veiled in the Host we see:
And to us the care is given
Of his wondrous poverty.
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!

Bread of Angels! Who can measure
All it means? This daily food?
And the daily granted treasure
Of his sacrificial blood?
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!

Bending low in adoration,
Ever constant let us be,
Making Jesus reparation
For the world's inconstancy.
Low in endless worship bent,
Praise the Blessed Sacrament!
