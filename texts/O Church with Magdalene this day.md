# O Church, with Magdalene this day

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

O Church, with Magdalene this day
Exalt the mercy of thy Lord,
By sevenfold grace who did away
The sevenfold bond of demon horde.

With faithful band from Galilee
She served her Master in his need;
Unto the end on Calvary
She stayed, his last great cry to heed.

To God the Father, God the Son,
and Holy Spirit, Paraclete,
In persons three and Godhead one,
Be everlasting praises meet.
