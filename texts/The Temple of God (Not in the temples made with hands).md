# The Temple of God (Not in the temples made with hands)

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (LONDON NEW)

Not in the temples made with hands,
Tho' beautiful by art;
But God in mercy condescends
To dwell within my heart.

How wonderful that He would take
This poor abode of sin,
And wash me in His precious blood,
And now abide within!

No more I think of God afar,
But see Thee, Lord, within;
Oh, shine in me, Thou morning star,
And keep Thy temple clean.

O Lord, enshrine within my breast,
My constant joy and peace;
My soul can now forever rest,
Secure in Thy embrace.
