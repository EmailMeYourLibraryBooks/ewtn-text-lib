## Setting: Traditional chant

O Adonai, et Dux domus Israel,
qui Moysi in igne flammae rubi apparuisti,
et ei in Sina legem dedisti:
Veni ad redimen dum nos in brachio extento.

O Lord of Lords and Leader of the house of Israel,
who appeared to Moses in the bushâ€™s flaming fire
and gave to him the Law of Sinai:
Come to redeem us with stretched out arms.
