# See the conqueror mounts in triumph

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

See the Conqueror mounts in triumph;
See the King in royal state,
Riding on the clouds his chariot,
To his heavenly palace gate!
Hark! the choir of angel voices
Joyful alleluias sing.
And the portals high are lifted
To receive their heavenly King.

He who on the cross did suffer,
He who from the grave arose,
He has vanquised sin and Satan;
He by death has spoiled his foes.
While he lifts his hands in blessing,
He is parted from his friends;
While their eager eyes behold him,
He upon the clouds ascends.

Thou has raised our human nature
On the clouds to Godâ€™s right hand:
There we sit in heavenly places,
There with thee in glory stand.
Jesus reigns, adored by angels;
Man with God iis on the throne;
Mighty Lord, in thine ascension,
We by faith behold our own.
