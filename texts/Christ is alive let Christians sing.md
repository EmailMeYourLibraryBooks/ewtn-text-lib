# Christ is alive! let Christians sing

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

 Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
The cross stands empty to the sky.
Let streets and homes with praises ring.
Love, drowned in death, shall never die.

Christ is alive! No longer bound
to distant years in Palestine,
but saving, healing, here and now,
and touching ev’ry place and time.

Christ is alive, and comes to bring
good news to this and ev’ry age,
till earth and sky and ocean ring
with joy, with justice, love, and praise.
