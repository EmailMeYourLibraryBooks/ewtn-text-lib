# Like the murmur of the dove's song

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Like the murmur of the dove’s song,
like the challenge of her flight,
like the vigor of the wind’s rush,
like the new flame’s eager might:
come, Holy Spirit, come.

To the members of Christ’s body,
to the branches of the Vine,
to the church in faith assembled,
to her midst as gift and sign:
come, Holy Spirit, come.

With the healing of division,
with the ceaseless voice of prayer,
with the pow’r to love and witness,
with the peace beyond compare:
come, Holy Spirit, come.
