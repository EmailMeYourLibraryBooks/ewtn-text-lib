# Two stalwart trees both rooted

***

## EWTN Hymn Supplement

To stalwart trees both rooted
in faith and holy love,
by hope of God united
they reach to heaven above.

One on a cross is martyr’d,
one by the sword is slain;
both triumph in their dying, 
both glorious sainthood gain.

The words of Paul assure us
of Christ’s redeeming word;
the words of Peter show us
how we may serve the Lord.

All glory to the Father,
All glory to the Son,
who with the Holy Spirit, 
Now reign, blest Three in One.
