# Jesu, thou crown of virgins

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (SONG 34)

Jesu, thou crown of virgins all,
In gracious mercy hear our call:
Son of that Virgin whom alone
The Mother and the Maid we own.

Food 'mid the lilies thou dost find,
Surrounded by the virgin kind;
In thee, their Bridegroom and their Lord,
Do virgins find their bright reward.

They, wheresoever thy footsteps wend,
With songs and praises thee attend.
In joyful troops they follow thee
With dance and sweetest melody.

O gracious Lord, we thee implore
Thy grace into our minds to pour;
From all defilement keep us free
And ever pure in heart for thee.

To thee, O Christ, the virgins' King,
May praise and thanks and glory ring;
With Father and the Spirit be
All glory thine eternally.
