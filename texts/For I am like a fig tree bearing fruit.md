For I am like a fig tree bearing fruit
In the house of God my Savior,
I am like a fig tree bearing fruit
In the house of the Lord for ever.
I will sing your goodness all the day,
Will for ever trust your kindness;
In the presence of your saints, O Lord,
I will praise your name for ever.

For I am like a fruitful olive tree
In the house of God my savior.
I am like a fruitful olive tree
In the house of the Lord forever.
I will sing your goodness all the day,
Will for ever trust your kindness;
In the presence of your saints, O Lord,
I will praise your name for ever.

For I am like a fruitful almond tree
In the house of God my savior.
I am like a fruitful almond tree
In the house of the Lord forever.
I will sing your goodness all the day,
Will for ever trust your kindness;
In the presence of your saints, O Lord,
I will praise your name for ever.

For I am like a fruitful walnut tree
In the house of God my savior.
I am like a fruitful walnut tree
In the house of the Lord forever.
I will sing your goodness all the day,
Will for ever trust your kindness;
In the presence of your saints, O Lord,
I will praise your name for ever.

For I am like a fruitful apple tree
In the house of God my savior.
I am like a fruitful apple tree
In the house of the Lord forever.
I will sing your goodness all the day,
Will for ever trust your kindness;
In the presence of your saints, O Lord,
I will praise your name for ever.
