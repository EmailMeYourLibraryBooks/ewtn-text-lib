# Because you live again, O Rose

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (Thaxton)

Because you live again, O Rose
Who bloomed in Guadalupe’s snows,
In this you image, flowering fair,
Our songs as flowers fill the air.

O Virgin, Rose in brambles grown,
Who chose this people for your own,
Your flowering image glorifies
The tangled brushwood of all our lives.

God made you lovely past compare,
Who chose this people for your own,
And then he fashioned you again,
An image which he gave to men.

We pray protect us as your own
And intercede at heaven’s throne;
While here we kneel before your face,
Send down a ray of saving grace.
