# Sacred Heart in accents burning

***

## Setting: Charles Gounod

Sacred Heart in accents burning
Pour we forth our love of Thee;
Here our hopes and here our yearnings
Meet and mingle tenderly.
Heart of mercy ever-eager,
All our woes and wounds to heal!
Heart most patient, Heart most pure!
To our souls, Thy depths reveal.

Sacred Heart of our Redeemer!
Pierced with love on Calvary!
Heart of Jesus everloving,
Make us burn with love of Thee!
Praise to Thee! O Sacred Heart!

Heart of bounty, Thou art bringing
All Thy thirsting children here,
Where the living waters springing
Tell of hope and comfort near.
O Thou Source of every blessing!
Sweetest, strongest, holiest, best!
Be our treasure here on earth,
And in heaven be Thou our rest!

Sacred Heart of our Redeemer!
Pierced with love on Calvary!
Heart of Jesus ever-loving,
Make us burn with love of Thee!
Praise to Thee! O Sacred Heart!
