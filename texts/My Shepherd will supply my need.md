# My Shepherd will supply my need,

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (Evans, RESIGNATION)

My shepherd will supply my need,
All Holy is his name;
In pastures fresh he makes me feed
Beside the living stream.
He brings my wandering spirit back
when I forsake his ways:
He leads me for his mercyâ€™s sake
In paths of truth and grace.

When I walk through the shads of death,
Thy presence is my stay;
One word of thy supporting breath
Drives all my fears away.
Thy hand in sight of all my foes
Doth still my table spread;
My cup with blessings overflows,
Thy oil anoints my head.

The sure provisions of my God
Attend me all my days;
O may thy house be my abode
And all thy works my praise.
There would I find a settled rest
Where others go and come;
No more a stranger or a guest,
But like a child at home.
