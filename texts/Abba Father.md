# Abba, Father

# Setting: Deborah Garcia

Abba, Father! Abba, Father!
You are the potter, we are the clay,
The works of your hands.

How great is your love for us! 
How great is your love!
That we should be called your children
How great is your love!

Abba, Father! Abba, Father!
You are the potter, we are the clay,
The works of your hands.

By the Spirit of God, we are
sons and daughters of God.
Out of slavery and from fear,
through a spirit of adoption.

Abba, Father! Abba, Father!
You are the potter, we are the clay,
The works of your hands.

All things are possible for you, O God,
and with your spirit in me.
May your will be done, O God,
May your will be done!

Abba, Father! Abba, Father!
You are the potter, we are the clay,
The works of your hands.
