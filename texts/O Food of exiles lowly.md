# O Food of exiles lowly

***

## Setting: Worship 4th Edition 557

O Food of exiles lowly, 
O Bread of angels holy,
O Manna from on high!
We hunger for your blessing,
All good in you possessing,
With favor hear our heart's outcry.

O cleansing water, streaming 
From Jesus' side, redeeming
All those of Adam's race!
O quenching fountain flowing,
Our ev'ry want bestowing,
O come and fill our souls with grace.

O Lord, we kneel before you
And fervently adore you,
All hid beneath this bread.
But make to us this promise:
To see you in your fullness,
The sacred body's mystic head.
