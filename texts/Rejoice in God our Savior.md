# Rejoice in God our Savior

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (CHRISTUS, DER IST MEIN LEBEN)

Rejoice in God our Savior,
O you of Adam’s race.
Before the world he ordered 
that we might see his face.

No sooner had we fallen
than we began to long
For Christ the Lord, Messiah
to turn us from our wrong.

In love, the Father sends us 
his own begotten Son,
that we might by his Spirit 
receive the life he won.

Rejoice, for soon we witness
in Bethlehem the star,
the sign of Jesus’ coming,
the Magi from afar.

They come to bow before him,
They know him as their King,
Through virgin birth, incarnate,
the One whose praise we sing.
