# O Heart of Mary, pure and fair

***

## Setting: FAIRFIELD

O heart of Mary, pure and fair
And free from sin’s domain,
In Adam’s fall you had no share;
In you there is no stain.
In Adam’s fall you had no share;
In you there is no stain.

As some fair lily grown in thorns,
Your heart so full of grace
With spotless purity adorns
Our sinful fallen race.
With spotless purity adorns
Our sinful fallen race.

The Heart of Christ, by God’s decree,
Was formed beneath your heart;
We long to love him worthily:
In your love give us part.
We long to love him worthily:
In your love give us part.
