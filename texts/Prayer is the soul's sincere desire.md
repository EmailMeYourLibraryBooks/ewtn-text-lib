# Prayer is the soul's sincere desire

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (ST. FLAVIAN)

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
Unuttered or expressed,
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.

Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
The majesty on high.

Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
The Christian native air,
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters heaven with prayer.

O thou, by whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way;
The path of prayer thyself hast trod:
Lord, teach us how to pray!
