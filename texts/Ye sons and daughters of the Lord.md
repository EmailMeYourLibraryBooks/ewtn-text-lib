# Ye sons and daughters of the Lord

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 412

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!

Ye sons and daughters of the Lord,
The King of Glory, King adored,
This day himself from death restored.
Alleluia!

At night the Apostles met in fear,
But Christ did in their midst appear:
"My peace," he saith, "be on all here."
Alleluia!

"My pierced side, O Thomas, see:
My hands, my feet, I show to thee:
Not faithless, but believing be."
Alleluia!

How blest are they who have not seen,
And yet whose faith has constant been,
For they eternal life shall win.
Alleluia!

Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia!
