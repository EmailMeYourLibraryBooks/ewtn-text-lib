# I heard a voice from heaven

***

## Setting: John Goss

I heard a voice from heaven,
saying unto me,
Write, from henceforth
blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord,
blessed are the dead
which die in the Lord:
Even so, saith the Spirit
Even so, saith the Spirit:
for they rest from their labours,
they rest, they rest from their labours.
Blessed are the dead 
which die in the Lord,
for they rest, 
they rest from their labours.
