# O Lord of Light, who made the stars

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 323

O Lord of light, who made the stars,
O Dawn, by whom we see the way,
O Christ, redeemer of the world:
Come now and listen as we pray!

In lowliness you came to earth
To rescue us from Satan’s snares;
Oh, wondrous love that healed our wounds
By taking on our mortal cares!

To pay the debt we owed for sin
Your painful cross was made the price;
From blessed Mary’s womb you came,
A victim pure for sacrifice.

But now you reign, the King of kings,
Adored in highest majesty;
Your very name is held in awe
From pole to pole and sea to sea!
Amen.
