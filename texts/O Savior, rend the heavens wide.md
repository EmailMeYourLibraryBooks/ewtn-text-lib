# O Savior, rend the heavens wide

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 38

O Savior, rend the heavens wide;
Come down, come down with mighty stride;
Unlock the the gates, the doors break down;
Unbar the way to heaven’s crown.

O Morning Star, O radiant Sun,
When will our hearts behold your dawn?
O Sun, arise; without your light
We grope in gloom and dark of night.

Sin’s dreadful doom upon us lies;
Grim death looms fierce before our eyes.
Oh, come, lead us with mighty hand
From exile to our promised land.

There shall we all our praises bring
Ever to you, our Savior King;
There shall we laud you adore
Forever and forevermore.
