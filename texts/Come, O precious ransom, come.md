# Come, O precious ransom, come

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 24

Come, O precious Ransom, come,
Only hope for sinful mortals!
Come, O Savior of the world;
Open are to you all portals.
Come, your beauty let us view;
Anxiously we wait for you.

Enter now my waiting heart,
Glorious King and Lord most holy.
Dwell in me and never leave,
Though I am but poor and lowly.
What vast riches will be mine
When you are my guest divine!

My hosannas and my palms
Graciously receive, I pray you;
Evermore, as best I can,
Homage I will gladly pay you,
And in faith I will embrace,
Life eternal by your grace.

Hail! Hosanna! David's Son!
Jesus, hear our supplication!
Let your kingdom, scepter, crown
Bring us blessing and salvation;
That forever we may sing:
Hail! Hosanna to our king!
