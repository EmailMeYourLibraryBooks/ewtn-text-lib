# The God of Abraham Praise

***

## Setting: The Hymnal 1982 401

The God of Abraham praise,
who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days,
and God of love;
the Lord, the great I AM,
by earth and heaven confessed:
we bow and bless the sacred Name
for ever blest.

He by himself hath sworn:
we on his oath depend;
we shall, on eagles-wings upborne,
to heaven ascend:
we shall behold his face,
we shall his power adore,
and sing the wonders of his grace
for evermore.

There dwells the Lord, our King,
the Lord, our Righteousness,
triumphant o'er the world and sin,
the Prince of Peace;
on Zion's sacred height
his kingdom he maintains,
and, glorious with his saints in light,
for ever reigns.

The God who reigns on high
the great archangels sing,
and “Holy, holy, holy,” cry,
“Almighty King!
Who was, and is, the same,
and evermore shall be:
eternal Father, great I AM,
we worship thee.”

The whole triumphant host
give thanks to God on high;
“Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost”
they ever cry;
hail, Abraham’s Lord divine!
With heaven our songs we raise;
all might and majesty are thine,
and endless praise.

The God of Abr'ham praise,
Who reigns enthroned above;
Ancient of everlasting days
And God of love.
Jehovah, great I AM!
By earth and heav'n confessed;
I bow and bless the sacred name
Forever blest.

The God of Abr'ham praise,
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise and seek the joys
At His right hand.
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and pow'r,
And Him my only portion make,
My shield and tow'r.

The God of Abr'ham praise,
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my pilgrim days
In all my ways.
He deigns to call me friend;
He calls Himself my God.
And He shall save me to the end
Through Jesus' blood.

He by Himself has sworn;
I on His oath depend.
I shall, on eagle wings upborne,
To heav'n ascend.
I shall behold His face;
I shall His pow'r adore
And sing the wonders of His grace
Forevermore.

Though nature's strength decay,
And earth and hell withstand,
To Canaan's bounds I urge my way
At His command.
The wat'ry deep I pass,
With Jesus in my view,
And through the howling wilderness
My way pursue.

The goodly land I see,
With peace and plenty blest:
A land of sacred liberty
And endless rest.
There milk and honey flow,
And oil and wine abound,
And trees of life forever grow
With mercy crowned.

There dwells the Lord our king,
The Lord our righteousness,
Triumphant o'er the world and sin,
The Prince of Peace.
On Zion's sacred height
His kingdom He maintains
And glorious with His saints in light
Forever reigns.

The God who reigns on high
The great archangels sing,
And, "Holy, holy, holy!" cry,
"Almighty King!
Who was and is the same
And evermore shall be;
Jehovah, Father, great I AM!
We worship Thee!"

The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high.
"Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!"
They ever cry.
Hail, Abr'ham's God and mine!
I join the heav'nly lays:
All might and majesty are Thine
And endless praise!
