# For the bread which you have broken

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 200 (ed. Derek Kluz)

For your body which was broken,
For your blood which has been poured,
For the words which you have spoken,
Now we give you thanks, O Lord.

By this promise that you love us,
By your gift of peace restored,
By your call to heav'n above us,
Hallow all our lives, O Lord.

With the saints who now adore you
Seated at our Father's board,
May the Church still waiting for you
Keep loveâ€™s tie unbroken, Lord.

In your service, Lord, defend us;
In our hearts keep watch and ward,
In the world to which you send us
Let your kingdom come, O Lord.
