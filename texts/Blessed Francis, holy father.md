## Setting: Hymn sheet (BEACH SPRING)

Blessed Francis, holy father,
Now our hearts to thee we raise,
As we gather round thine altar, 
Pouring forth out hymn of praise.
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
Who thy mighty help implore,
For in heaven thou remainest,
Still the father of the poor.

By the love so deep an burning,
For thy Savior crucified;
By the tokens which he gave thee,
On thy hands and feet and side:
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
With those wounded hands of thine,
From thy glorious throne in heaven
Where resplendently they shine.

Humble follower of Jesus,
Likened to Him in thy birth,
In thy way through life despising, 
For His sake, the goods of earth:
Make us love the priceless virtue
By our hidden God Esteemed,
Make it valued, holy Francis;
By the souls of the redeemed.

Teach us also, dear Saint Francis,
How to mourn for every sin;
May we walk in thy dear footsteps
Till the crown of life we win.
Bless thy children, holy Francis,
With those wounded hands of thine,
From thy glorious throne in heaven
Where resplendently they shine.
