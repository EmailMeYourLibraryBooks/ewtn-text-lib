# At the name of Jesus

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 602

At the name of Jesus
Ev'ry knee shall bow,
Ev'ry tongue confess Him
King of glory now;
’Tis the Father’s pleasure
We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the mighty Word.

Humbled for a season,
To receive a name
From the lips of sinners,
Unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death He passed;

Bore it up triumphant,
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
To the central height;
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father’s breast,
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.

In your hearts enthrone Him;
There let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true:
Crown Him as your Captain
In temptation's hour;
Let His will enfold you
In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
In His Father's glory,
O'er the earth to reign;
For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now.
