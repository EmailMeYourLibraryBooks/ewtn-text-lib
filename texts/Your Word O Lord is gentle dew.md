# Your Word, O Lord, is gentle dew

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 232

Your Word, O Lord, is gentle dew
To suff'ring hearts that want it;
Oh, shed your heav'nly balm anew,
To all your garden grant it;
Refreshed by you, may every tree
Bud forth and blossom gaily
And fruit and seed bring daily.

Your Word is like a flaming sword,
A sharp and mighty arrow,
A wedge that cleaves the rock; that Word
Can pierce through heart and marrow.
Oh, send it forth o'er all the earth,
To purge unrighteous leaven
And cleanse all hearts for heaven.

Your Word, a wondrous star, supplies
True guidance when we need it;
It points to Christ and so makes wise
All simple hearts that heed it;
Let not its light e'er sink in night,
But keep it brightly burning,
And fill our deepest yearning.
