# For all the faithful women

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

For all the faithful women
Who served in days of old,
To you shall thanks be given;
To all, their story told.
They served with strength and gladness
In tasks your wisdom gave.
To you their lives bore witness,
Proclaimed your power to save.

O God, for saints and servants,
Those named and those unknown,
In whom through all the ages
Your light of glory shone,
We offer glad thanksgiving
And fervent prayer we raise
That, faithful in your service,
Our lives may sing your praise.

All praise to God the Father!
All praise to Christ the Son!
All praise to God the Spirit!
Who binds the church as one!
With saints who went before us,
With saints who witness still,
We sing glad alleluias
And strive to do your will.
