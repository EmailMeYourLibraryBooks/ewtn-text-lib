# Out of the depths I cry to thee

## Setting: Hymn sheet (AUS TIEFER NOT)

Out of the depths I cry to thee;
Lord, hear me, I implore thee!
Bend down thy gracious ear to me;
I lay my sins before thee.
If thou remembered each misdeed,
If each should have its rightful meed,
Who may abide thy presence?

Thou grantest pardon through thy love;
Thy grace alone availeth.
Our works could ne’er our guilt remove;
Yea, e’en the best life faileth.
For none may boast himself of aught,
But must confss thy grace hath wrought 
Whate’er in him is worthy.

And thus my hope is in the Lord,
And not in my own merit;
I rest upon his faithful word
To them of contrite spirit.
That he is merciful and just,
Here is my comfort and my trust;
His help I wait with patience.
