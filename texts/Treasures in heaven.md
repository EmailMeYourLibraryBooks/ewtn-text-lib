# Treasures in heaven

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and steal.

Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,
where moth and rust doth corrupt,
and where thieves break through and steal.

But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt,
nor can thieves break through and steal;
So lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven,
For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
