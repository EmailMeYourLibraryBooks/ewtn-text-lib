# Blessed are they who do his commandments

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Blessed are they who do his commandments,
They shall claim the tree of life;
Into the city they shall enter,
They are victors in the strife. 

Blessed are they who do His commandments,
Blessed are they, blessed are they;
Into the city they shall enter,
Blessed are they, blessed are they.

Blessed are they who do His commandments,
They shall wear the robes of white;
Under the portals God shall lead them,
They shall serve Him day and night.

Blessed are they who do His commandments,
Blessed are they, blessed are they;
Into the city they shall enter,
Blessed are they, blessed are they.

Blessed are they who do his commandments,
They shall stand before the throne;
Into the life of joy eternal,
God shall claim them for his own.

Blessed are they who do His commandments,
Blessed are they, blessed are they;
Into the city they shall enter,
Blessed are they, blessed are they.

Blessed, blessed, blessed are they.
