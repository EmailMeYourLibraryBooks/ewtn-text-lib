# The Kingdom of Our God

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (EXCELSIOR)

The kingdom of our God is like
A grain of mustard seed,
When it is sown within the earth,
It is the smallest seed.

When it is sown, it grows into
A large and fruitful tree,
Greater than all the herbs of earth,
A tree for all to see.

It flourishes so bird may rest
Inside its crown of leaves,
Deep in its shadows, hid'n away
From any evil pray.

And so we liken mustard seeds
To those which make great trees.
God's kingdom, like a mustard seed,
A wondrous mystery.
