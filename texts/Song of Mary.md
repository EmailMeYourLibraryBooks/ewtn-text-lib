# Song of Mary

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
My spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
For he has looked with favor on his humble servant,
From this day all generations will call me blessed,
the Almighty has done great things for me, and Holy is His Name.

He has shown mercy on those who fear him.
He shows each day the strength of his arm.
He scatters the proud in their conceit.
He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
and has lifted up the humble and the meek,
and Holy is his name.

For He has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent empty away.
He comes tot eh help of his servant Israel,
For his remembrance of his mercy,
the promise to our fathers,
Abraham and his children forever,
and holy is His Name.

Glory to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit, Three-in-One,
As it was in the beginning, now and ever shall be,
world without end, amen, amen.

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
and Holy is His name.
