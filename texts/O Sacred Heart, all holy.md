# O Sacred Heart, all holy

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 511

O Sacred Heart, all holy,
That heart so meek and lowly,
Our hardened hearts refine,
For in your heart is treasure,
Of goodness without measure,
Of mercy, grace, and love divine.
 
Your heart for love is yearning,
While we to sin are turning,
Unmindful of your love,
But in your gracious kindness,
Lord, cure us of our blindness,
And lead us to your throne above.
