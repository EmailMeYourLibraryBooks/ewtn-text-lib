# Draw nigh to Thy Jerusalem

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (WOODLANDS, MINISTRY)

Draw nigh to thy Jerusalem, O Lord, 
thy faithful people cry with one accord:
ride on in triumph; Lord, behold, we lay 
our passions, lusts, and proud wills in thy way.

Thy road is ready, and thy paths,
made straight, with longing expectations seem to wait
the consecration of thy beauteous feet,
and silently thy promised advent greet.

Hosanna! welcome to our hearts,
for here thou hast a temple too, as Zion dear;
yes, dear as Zion, and as full of sin;
how long shall theives and robbers dwell therein?

Enter and chase them forth,
and cleanse the floor; o'erthrow them all, that they
may nevermore profane with traffic vile that holy place
where thou hast chosen, Lord, to set thy face.

And then, if our stiff tongues shall faithlessly
be mute in praises of thy deity,
the very temple stones shall loud repeat
Hosanna! and thy glorious footsteps greet.
