# Light of life! Seraphic fire!

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Light of Life! Seraphic Fire!
Every fainting soul inspire;
Shine in every drooping heart,
Love divine! Thyself impart.
Scatter all our guilty gloom:
To thy human temples come.
Every mournful sinner cheer;
Savior, Son of God, appear!

Lord of hosts, how lovely fair, E’en on earth thy temples are;
Here thy waiting people see
Much of heaven, and much of thee.
While thy Spirit’s holy fire
Warms our hearts with pure desire.
Thus with sacred songs of joy
We our happy lives employ.

Come, in this accepted hour,
Fill us with thy glorious power;
Rooting out the love of sin,
Bring thy heavenly kingdom in.
Nbothing more can we require,
Be thou all our heart’s desire;
We will covet nothing less,
All our peace and happiness.
Amen.
