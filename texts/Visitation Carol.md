# Visitation Carol

## Setting: arr. Banks

When, to Mary, the Word from the throne of the Lord
Made journey to the earth on that day,
Mary turned not within, but, with haste, to her kin;
She set out for a land far away.

At the sound of her voice did her cousin rejoice,
While the babe in her womb danced around;
For when Jesus, the Lamb, spoke his silent “I AM,”
Prophet’s ears filled with joy at the sound.

Like our Mother, we should give our neighbor our good,
As within us the secret is hid;
For, in truth, then will show for all others to know
All the wonders that God for us did.

And as John surely knew, although hidden from view,
That the Lord was indeed with them there,
So may we with delight take within our own sight
Jesus, living in souls everywhere.
