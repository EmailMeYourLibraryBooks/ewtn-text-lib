# O radiant Light, O sun divine

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 618

O radiant Light, O sun divine
Of God the Fatherâ€™s deathless face,
We praise the Father with the Son,
That fills the heavenly dwelling place.

Lord Jesus Christ, as daylight fades,
As shine the lights of eventide,
We praise the Father with the Son,
The Spirit blest and with them one.

O Son of God, the source of life,
Praise is your due by night and day;
Unsullied lips must raise the strain
Of your proclaimed and splendid name.
