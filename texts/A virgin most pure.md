# A virgin most pure

***

## Timothy Paul Banks

A virgin most pure as the prophets do tell,
Hath brought forth a baby, as it hath befell;
To be our Redeemer from death, hell, and sin,
Which Adamâ€™s transgression involved us in.

Aye, and therefore be merry, Rejoice,
and be you merry, Set sorrow aside,
Christ Jesus our Savior was born at this tide.

The King of all kings to this world being brought,
Small store of fine linen to wrap him was sought;
And when she had swaddled her young son so sweet,
Within an ox-manger she laid him to sleep.

Aye, and therefore be merry, Rejoice,
and be you merry, Set sorrow aside,
Christ Jesus our Savior was born at this tide.

Then presently after the shepherds did spy
A number of angels that stood in the sky; 
They joyfully talked and sweetly did sing:
To God be all Glory, our heavenly King!

Aye, and therefore be merry, Rejoice,
and be you merry, Set sorrow aside,
Christ Jesus our Savior was born at this tide.
