# Holy light on earth's horizon

***

## Setting: Evans (FIRST MARTYR)

Holy light on earth’s horizon,
Star of hope to fallen man,
Light amid a world of shadows,
Dawn of God’s redemptive plan.
Chosen from eternal ages, 
Thou alone of all our race,
But thy Son’s atoning merits
Wast conceived in perfect grace.

Mother of the world’s Redeemer,
Promised from the dawn of time:
How could one so highly favored
Share the guilt of Adam’s crime?
Sun and moon and stars adorn thee,
Sinless Eve, triumphant sign;
Thou art she who crushed the serpent,
Mary, pledge of life divine.

Earth below and highest heaven
Praise the splendor of thy state,
Thou who now art crowned in glory
Wast conceived immaculate.
Hail, beloved of the Father,
Mother of his only Son,
Mystic bride of Love eternal,
Hail, thou fair and spotless one!
