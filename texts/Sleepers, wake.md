# Sleepers, wake

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 186

"Sleepers, wake!" A voice astounds us,
The shout of rampart guards surrounds us:
"Awake, Jerusalem, arise!"
Midnight's peace their cry has broken,
Their urgent summons clearly spoken:
"The time has come, O maidens wise!
Rise up, and give us light;
The Bridegroom is in sight.
Alleluia!
Your lamps prepare and hasten there,
That you the wedding feast may share"

Zion hears the watchmen singing;
Her heart with joyful hope is springing,
She sakes and hurries through the night.
Forth he comes, her Bridegroom glorious
In strength of grace, in truth victorious:
Her star is risen, her light grows bright.
Now come, most worthy Lord,
God's Son, incarnate Word,
Alleluia!
We follow all and heed your call
To come into the banquet hall.

Lamb of God, the heavens adore you;
Let saints and angels sing before you,
As harps and cymbals swell the sound.
Twelve great pearls, the city's portals:
Through them we stream to join the immortals
As we with joy your throne surround.
No eye has known the sight,
No ear heard such delight:
Alleluia!
Therefore we sing to greet our King;
For ever let our praises ring.
