# When Christ our Lord to Andrew cried

When Christ our Lord to Andrew cried:
"Come, thou, and follow me,"
The fisher left his net beside
The Sea of Galilee.
To teach the truth his Master taught,
To tread the path he trod
Was all his will, and thus he brought
Unnumbered souls to God.

When Andrew's hour had come, and he
Was doomed like Christ to die,
He kissed his cross exultingly,
And this his loving cry:
"O noble cross, O precious wood!
I long have yearned for thee;
Uplift me to my only Good
Who died on thee for me."

Saint Andrew, now in bliss above,
Thy fervent prayers renew
That Christian lands again may love
The faith, entire and true;
That I the cross allotted me
May bear with patient love!
"Twill lift me, as it lifted thee,
To reign with Christ above."
