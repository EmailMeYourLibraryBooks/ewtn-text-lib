# Holy Stephen, Christ’s dear martyr

## HS—Thaxton

Holy Stephen, Christ’s dear martyr,  
First to shed thy blood for him,  
What bright glory now surrounds thee,  
Glory which no time can dim!  
O that we could share that glory;  
Give for him our life and blood!  
Let us praise thy noble story,  
Told with life’s own crimson flood.  

Noble witness thou didst render  
To the Passion of thy Lord,  
Bearing with a love courageous  
Weight of stones more cruel than sword:  
Mindful of our dying Savior;  
Begging mercy in death’s throes  
Thou didst raise thine eyes to heaven,  
Craving mercy on thy foes.  

Ours it may not be to suffer  
Like Saint Stephen unto death,  
But a service we can render,  
To our last and failing breath:  
Ours to serve our loving Savior;  
Ours to help his sacrifice:  
Ours to give him daily homage:  
Till he calls to Paradise.
