# O heart, the ark that holds the law

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

O Heart, the ark that holds the law—
Not that whence bondage came of old,
Bt law of pardon and of grace
And law of mercy manifold;

O Heart, for the new covenant
The spotless shrine unto us given;
The Temple holier than of old,
Its veil more useful than that riven.

For love decreed that thou shouldst bear
From lance’s thrust the open wound,
That of the love invisible
We might adore the hidden wound.

Beneath this sign of love, behold,
A Victim, blodied, mystic, lies;
Our Christ as Priest hath offered up
In both these ways his sacrifice.

All glory, Jesu, unto thee,
Who from thy Heart dost grace outpour,
With Father and with Spirit blest,
Through endless ages evermore.
