# O quickly come, great judge of all\

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet

O quickly come, great Judge of all;
For glorious though thine advent be,
All shadows from the truth will fall,
And falsehood die, in sight of thee:
O quickly come! for doubt and fear
Like clouds dissolve when thou art near.

O quickly come, true life of all;
Death’s mighty powers do still abound;
In every place his shadows fall,
On every heart his mark is found:
O quickly come! for grief and pain
Can never cloud thy glorious reign.

O quickly come, thy people save;
Reign all around us, and within;
Let sin no more our souls enslave,
Let pain and sorrow die with sin:
O quickly come! for thou alone
Canst make thy scattered people one.
