# Wisdom, my road

***

## Setting: Gather Comprehensive 500

Long before my journey start,  
When in my youth I searched in my heart,  
I would pray for her, wait for her,  
Wisdom, my road, my goal, and my star.

From the blossom to the seed,  
Long has she filled my cup in need,  
May I cling to her vine, taste of her wine,  
Wisdom, my life, my perfect design.

When I stretched my hands to the sky,  
When in despair my soul raised a cry,  
I was saved by her gaze, led in her ways,  
Wisdom, my love, the light of my days.
