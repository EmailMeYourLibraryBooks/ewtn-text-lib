# God, in whom all grace doth dwell

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (NUN KOMM, DER HEIDEN HEILAND) 

God, in whom all grace doth dwell!
Grant us grace to ponder well 
On the Virgin's sorrows seven;
On the wounds to Jesus given.

May the tears which Mary poured
Gain us pardon of the Lord--
Tears excelling in their worth 
All the penances of earth.

May the contemplation sore
Of the wounds which Jesus bore, 
Source to us of blessings be, 
Through a long eternity.
