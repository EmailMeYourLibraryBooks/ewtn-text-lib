# Isaiah 48:18-19

***

## Setting: Chris Hills

If only you had paid attention to my commandments,
Your peace would have been like a river,
Your well-being like the waves of the sea,
Your descendants would have been like the sand,
Their children like its numberless grains.

If only you had paid attention to my commandments,
Your peace would have been like a river,
Your well-being like the waves of the sea,
Your descendants would have been like the sand,
Their children like its numberless grains;

Their name would not be blotted out,
nor destroyed from before me.
