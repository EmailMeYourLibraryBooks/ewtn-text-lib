# All that I am

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 373

All that I am, all that I do,
All that I'll ever have, I offer now to you.

All that I dream, all that I pray,
All that I'll ever make, I give to you today.

Take and sanctify these gifts
For your honor, Lord,
Knowing that I love and serve you
Is enough reward.
