# God, whose purpose is to kindle

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (Beach Spring)

God, whose purpose is to kindle, 
now ignite us with your fire;
While the earth awaits your burning, 
with your passion us inspire.
Overcome our sinful calmness, 
stir us with your saving name.
Baptize with your fiery Spirit, 
crown our lives with tongues of flame.

God, who still a sword delivers 
rather than a placid peace,
With your sharpened Word disturb us, 
from complacency release!
Save us now from satisfaction, 
when we privately are free,
Yet are undisturbed in sprit 
by our neighborâ€™s misery.

God, who in your holy gospel 
wills that all should truly live,
Make us sense our share of failure, 
our tranquility forgive.
Teach us courage as we struggle 
in all liberating strive.
Lift the smallness of our vision 
by your own abundant life.
