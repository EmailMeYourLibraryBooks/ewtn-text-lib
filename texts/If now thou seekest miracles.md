# If now thou seekest miracles

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

If now thou seekest miracles:
Death, error, all calamities,
The leprosy and demons flee,
The sick by him made whole arise.
 
The sea withdraws and fetters break;
The withered limbs he doth restore,
While treasures lost are found again,
When young or old his help implore.
 
All dangers vanish from our path,
Our direst needs do quickly flee;
Let those who know repeat the theme:
Let Christians praise Saint Anthony.
