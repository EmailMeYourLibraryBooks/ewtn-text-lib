# He who would valiant be

***

## Setting: Hymnal 1982

He who would valiant be 
'gainst all disaster,
let him in constancy 
follow the Master.
There's no discouragement 
shall make him once relent
his first avowed intent 
to be a pilgrim.

Who so beset him round 
with dismal stories
do but themselves confound, 
his strength the more is.
No foes shall stay his might, 
though he with giants fight;
he will make good his right 
to be a pilgrim.

Since, Lord, thou dost defend 
us with thy Spirit,
we know we at the end 
shall life inherit.
Then fancies flee away; 
I'll fear not what men say,
I'll labor night and day 
to be a pilgrim.
