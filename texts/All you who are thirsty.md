# All you who are thirsty

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

All you who are thirsty, Come to the water,
All you who hunger, Come, receive grain;
All without money, Come without paying;
All you who heed me, Come for richest gain.
 
Seek ye the Lord while he may yet be found,
Call ye upon him while he is near.
Let now the wicked forsake his sinful ways,
And the evil one repent his evil thoughts.
 
All you who are thirsty, Come to the water,
All you who hunger, Come, receive grain;
All without money, Come without paying;
All you who heed me, Come for richest gain.
 
Turn to the Lord, mercy he will freely give;
Turn to our God, his pardon is free.
Go out in total joy, and be led forth in perfect peace;
All the trees will clap their hands, mountains sing with glee.
 
All you who are thirsty, Come to the water,
All you who hunger, Come, receive grain;
All without money, Come without paying;
All you who heed me, Come for richest gain.
