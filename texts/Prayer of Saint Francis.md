Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.
(Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace.)
Where there is hatred let me sow love.
(Where there is hatred let me sow love.)
Where there is injury, pardon.
(Where there is injury, pardon.)
where there is doubt, faith;
where thereâ€™s despair, hope,
where there is darkness,
where there is darkness, light,
and where there is sadness joy.

O Divine Master,
grant that I may not so much
seek to be consoled, but to console;
not so much to be understood
as to understand;
not so much to be loved as to love;
for it is in giving that we receive;
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned;
and it is in dying that we are born
to eternal life. Amen.
