# The great command Jehovah gave

***

## Setting: Thaxton (AD CENAM AGNI PROVIDI)

Great God, to thee I humbly pray;
Fill us with holy fear and awe;
Make us afraid to disobey
Or break thy just and holy law.

The great command Jehovah gave,
No other Gods but only me
Shall ye my chosen People have,
Your only trust in me shall be.

Ye shall not take my Name in vain,
I am your just and holy Lord;
Unpunished ye cannot remain
Who thus profane my sacred word.

Remember well the Sabbath day,
It is the day I have ordained
For men to spend in such a way
That saving knowledge may be gained.
Honor thy parents with delight,
And help and succor them always;
For that is lawful just and right;
Thou shalt be blest with length of days.

"This is my just and holy law,"
Saith God to Moses on the hill.
Give us, O Lord, the power to keep
This covenant, a steadfast will.
