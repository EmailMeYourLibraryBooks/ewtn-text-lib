# My soul is longing and pining

***

## Setting: Gregory K. Evans

My soul is longing and pining
for the courts of the Lord;
My heart and my flesh sing for joy
to the Living God.

The sparrow herself finds a home
and the swallow a nest for her brood;
she lays her young by your altars,
Lord of hosts, my king and my God.

My soul is longing and pining
for the courts of the Lord;
My heart and my flesh sing for joy
to the Living God.

They are happy, who dwell in your house,
for ever singing your praise.
They are happy, whose strength is in you,
in whose hearts are the roads to Sion.

My soul is longing and pining
for the courts of the Lord;
My heart and my flesh sing for joy
to the Living God.
