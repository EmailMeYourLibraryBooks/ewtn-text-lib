# This is the truth sent from above

***

## Setting: Evans/Vaughan Williams (SATB)

This is the truth sent from above,
The truth of God, the God of love, 
Therefore don't turn me from your door,
But hearken all both rich and poor.

The first thing which I do relate
Is that our God did man create;
The next thing which to you I'll tell:
Woman was made with man to dwell.

Thus we were heirs to endless woes,
Till God the Lord did interpose;
And so a promise soon did run,
That he would redeem us by his Son.
