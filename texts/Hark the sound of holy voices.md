# Hark! the sound of holy voices

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (Sanctuary)

Hark! the sound of holy voices,
chanting at the crystal sea;
Alleluia, alleluia,
Alleluia, Lord to thee:
Multitude which none can number,
like the stars in glory stands,
clothed in white apparel, holding
palms of vict'ry in their hands.

Patriarch and holy prophet,
who prepared the way of Christ,
king, apostle, saint, confessor,
martyr and evangelist,
saintly maiden, godly matron,
widows who have watched in prayer,
joined in holy concert, singing
to the Lord of all, are there.

God of God, the one-begotten,
Light of Light, Emmanuel,
in whose body joined together
all the saints forever dwell;
pour upon us of thy fullness,
that we may for evermore,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
truly worship and adore.
Amen, amen, amen.

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (DRAKE'S BOUGHTON)

Hark! the sound of holy voices,
chanting at the crystal sea;
Alleluia, alleluia,
Alleluia, Lord to thee.

Multitude which none can number,
like the stars in glory stands,
clothed in white apparel, holding
palms of vict'ry in their hands.

Now they reign in heavenly glory,
Now they walk in golden light,
Now they drink, as from a river,
Holy bliss and infinite:

Love and peace they taste for ever,
And all truth and knowledge see
In the beatific vision
Of the blessed Trinity.
