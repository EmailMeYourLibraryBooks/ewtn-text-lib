# There is nothing concealed

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

There is nothing concealed 
that will not be revealed, 
nor secret that will not be known. 
Therefore whatever you have said in the darkness 
will be heard in the light, 
and what you have whispered behind closed doors 
will be proclaimed on the housetops. 
*(Optionally repeated)*

I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me before others, 
I will acknowledge before the angels of God.
