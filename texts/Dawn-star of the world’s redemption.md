# Dawn-star of the world’s redemption

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (REGENT SQUARE)

Dawn-Star of the world’s redemption,
Lo! we hail thee “full of grace!”
Destined Mother of the Savior 
Promised to our fallen race,
Kings and prophets have foretold thee
And desired to see thy face.

Called by God’s divine election
To a wondrous destiny
And preserved by His protection
From all sin and evil free,
Mother of His Son Incarnate
Yet a virgin still to be.

Sorrow, pain and deep affliction
Marked thy pathway here on earth
From the moment of thy “Fiat” 
To the day which saw His birth
And the dreadful consummation
In the mystery of His death.

But when He achieved our ransom
Raised aloft on Calvary,
Mother of mankind he named thee,
Of the souls he had redeemed.
A new Eve to guard the Eden
In the mystery of His death.

Therefore now we praise the Father
And His well-beloved Son,
With the sanctifying Spirit
Ever reigning with Them One.
Praise we God, the One Eternal,
For the marvels he has done!
