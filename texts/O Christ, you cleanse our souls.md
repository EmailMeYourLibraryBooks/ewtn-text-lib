# O Christ, you cleanse our souls

***

## Setting: Michael Thaxton

O Christ, who came to Galilee;
To heal the sick, to set us free, Who moved for us to Calvary.
O Christ, You cleanse our souls.

O Christ, who washes lepers clean;
Who raises dead, who stands serene At God's right hand, from stable mean.
O Christ, You cleanse our souls.

O Christ, unmoved by demon's wrath Who casts them out, yet holds us fast;
Who cleanses those upon the path.
O Christ, You cleanse our souls.

O Christ, we gather at Your feet;
To touch Your hem, to be complete;
To sing to You on Holy Seat.
O Christ, You cleanse our souls.
