Blessed are you, Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth;
You have revealed to little ones 
the mysteries of the kingdom.

God will bless you, and watch over you.
God’s face shines on you today.
God will bless you, and rise upon you.
God will give you peace.

Blessed are you, Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth;
You have revealed to little ones 
the mysteries of the kingdom.

Listen, listen, little children,
Close to God you’ll always be.
Do not stop them, do not hinder them,
Children of the Kingdom!

Blessed are you, Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth;
You have revealed to little ones 
the mysteries of the kingdom.

Welcome them, comfort them, 
love and care for them.
From the Father, they are blessings. 
Children of God!

Blessed are you, Father, 
Lord of heaven and earth;
You have revealed to little ones 
the mysteries of the kingdom.
