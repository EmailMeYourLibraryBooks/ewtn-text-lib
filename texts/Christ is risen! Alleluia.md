Christ is risen! Alleluia!
Risen our victorious head!
Sing his praises! Alleluia!
Christ is risen from the dead!
Gratefully our hearts adore him
As his light once more appears;
Bowing down in joy before him,
Rising up from griefs and tears.
Christ is risen! Alleluia!
Risen our victorious head!
Sing his praises! Alleluia!
Christ is risen from the dead!

Christ is risen! All the sadness
Of our Lenten fast is o’er;
Through the open gates of gladness
He returns to life once more;
Death and hell before him bending
See him rise, the victor now,
Angels on his steps attending,
Glory round his wounded brow.
Christ is risen! Alleluia!
Risen our victorious head!
Sing his praises! Alleluia!
Christ is risen from the dead!

Christ is risen! All the sorrow
That last evening round him lay
Now has found a glorious morrow
In the rising of today.
See the grave its first-fruits giving,
Springing up from holy ground;
He was dead, but now is living;
He was lost, but he is found.
Christ is risen! Alleluia!
Risen our victorious head!
Sing his praises! Alleluia!
Christ is risen from the dead!

Christ is risen! Henceforth never
Death or hell shall us enthrall;
Be we Christ’s, in him forever
We have triumphed over all.
All the doubting and dejection
Of our trembling hearts have ceased;
Hail the day of resurrection!
Let us rise and keep the feast.
Christ is risen! Alleluia!
Risen our victorious head!
Sing his praises! Alleluia!
Christ is risen from the dead!
