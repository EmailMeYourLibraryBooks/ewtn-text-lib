# Behold! Behold he cometh

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (IMMANUEL (Webbe))

Behold! behold He cometh,
Who doth salvation bring;
Lift up hour heads rejoicing,
And welcome Zion's King;
With hymns of joy we praise the Lord,
Hosanna to th'Incarnate Word!

Hosanna to the Saviour,
Who came on Christmas morn,
And, of a lowly Virgin,
Was in a stable born;
Immanuel! Blessed Jesus! come!
Within Thy children make Thy home.

Yea, come in love and meekness
Our Saviour now to be;
Come to be formed in us,
And make us like to Thee,
Before the Day of Wrath draw near,
When, as our Judge, Thou shalt appear.
