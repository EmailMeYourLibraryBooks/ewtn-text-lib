## Setting: Hymn Sheet (DIVINE MYSTERY)

Sweet Sacrament divine, 
our shepherd and our king,
Around thy earthly shrine, 
with grateful hearts we sing.
Jesus to thee our voice we raise: 
in songs of love and joyful praise,
Sweet Sacrament divine, 
sweet Sacrament divine!

Sweet Sacrament of peace,
In thee mankind is blest,
All pain and sorrows cease,
And human hearts find rest.
Upon thy promise we rely:
"Who eats this Bread will never die,"
Sweet Sacrament of peace,
Sweet Sacrament of peace.

Sweet Sacrament of rest,
Ark from the ocean's roar,
Within thy shelter blest
Soon may we reach the shore:
Save us, for still the tempest raves,
Save lest we sink beneath the waves,
Sweet Sacrament of rest,
Sweet sacrament of rest.

Sweet Sacrament divine,
Earth's light and jubilee,
In thy far depths doth shine 
Thy Godhead's majesty:
Sweet light, so shine on us we pray,
That earthly joys may fade away,
Sweet Sacrament divine,
Sweet Sacrament divine.
