# Keep me faithfully in thy paths

***

## Setting: George Frideric Handel

Keep me faithfully in thy paths, O Lord,
in thy paths, O Lord, and cleanse me,
cleanse me from my sin.
Keep me faithfully in thy paths, O Lord,
in thy paths, O Lord, and cleanse me,
cleanse me from my sin.
Keep me faithfully in thy paths, O Lord,
in thy paths, O Lord, and cleanse me,
cleanse me from my sin.

In thy goodness, Lord, be thou merciful,
In thy goodness, Lord, be thou merciful.
Keep me faithfully in thy paths, O Lord,
in thy paths, O Lord, and cleanse me from my sin.
In thy goodness, Lord, be thou merciful,
In thy goodness, Lord, be thou merciful.
Keep me faithfully in thy paths, O Lord,
in thy paths, O Lord, and cleanse me from my sin.
