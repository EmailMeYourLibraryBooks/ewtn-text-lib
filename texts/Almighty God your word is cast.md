# Almighty God, your word is cast

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 631

 Almighty God, your Word is cast
like seed into the ground;
now let the dew of heav'n descend
and righteous fruits abound.

Let not our selfishness and hate
this holy seed remove,
but give it root in ev'ry heart
to bring forth fruits of love.

Let not the world's deceitful cares
the rising plant destroy,
but let it yield a hundredfold
the fruits of peace and joy.

And when the precious seed is sown,
Your quickening grace bestow
that all whose souls the truth receive
its saving pow'r may know.
