God Father, praise and glory
Your children come to sing.
Goodwill and peace to mankind.
The gifts your kingdom brings.

O most Holy Trinity.
Undivided Unity;
Holy God, Mighty God.
God Immortal, be adored.

And you, Lord Coeternal,
God's sole begotten Son;
O Jesus. King anointed.
You have redemption won. 

O most Holy Trinity.
Undivided Unity;
Holy God, Mighty God.
God Immortal, be adored.

O Holy Ghost, Creator
The Gift of God most high;
Life, love and holy wisdom,
Our weakness now supply. 

O most Holy Trinity.
Undivided Unity;
Holy God, Mighty God.
God Immortal, be adored.
