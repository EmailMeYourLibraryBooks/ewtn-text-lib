# Sing the holy family’s praises

## EHS RAQUEL

Sing the holy family’s praises:
Mary, mother of her Lord;
Joseph, chosen to protect her;
Jesus, subject to their word.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, help us,
that our homes on earth may be
One in love and deep affection
with the holy family.

Mary, you alone were chosen
to be mother of your Lord;
You were guide unto the footsteps
of the Infant, Christ adored.
Dearest Mother, make us humble,
for your Son will take his rest
In the poor and humble dwelling
of a humble sinner’s breast.

Joseph, you were called the father
of your Maker and your Lord;
You were sent to save your Savior 
from the cruel Herod’s sword.
Grant that we may call you father;
show to us a father’s love:
Lead us safe from every danger
till we meet in heaven above.

Sing the holy family’s praises:
Mary, mother of her Lord;
Joseph, chosen to protect her;
Jesus, subject to their word.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph, help us,
that our homes on earth may be
One in love and deep affection
with the holy family.
