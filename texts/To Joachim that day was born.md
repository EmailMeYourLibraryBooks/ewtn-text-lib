To Joachim that day was born
Blest daughter of the morn;
The brightest star of morning she,
A Rose that here adorns;
From Anna did come forth on earth
The splendor of the skies:

Rejoice, O blessed Joachim,
O blessed Anne, rejoice!
Ye parents of Our Lady,
O blessed pair, rejoice!

Now Jesse’s rod of old has flower’d,
Its bud most wondrous fruit;
The Prophet’s word has come to pass,
Salvation, life anew;
The dragon trod upon shall be
When her the earth shall see:

Rejoice, O blessed Joachim,
O blessed Anne, rejoice!
Ye parents of Our Lady,
O blessed pair, rejoice!

The parents of Christ’s mother bright,
With merit and such grace,
Do intercede for us this day,
For all the human race,
To bring us safely to the land
Where Christ and Mary reign:

Rejoice, O blessed Joachim,
O blessed Anne, rejoice!
Ye parents of Our Lady,
O blessed pair, rejoice!
