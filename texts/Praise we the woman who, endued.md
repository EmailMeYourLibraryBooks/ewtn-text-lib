# Praise we the woman who, endued

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (ADESTO SANCTA TRINITAS)

Praise we the woman who, endued
With high heroic fortitude,
Has won renown that shall not die,
A place among the saints on high.

Such holy love inflamed her breast,
She would not seek on earth her rest,
But, strong in faith and patience, trod
The narrow path that leads to God.

O Christ, the strength of all the strong,
To whom alone high deeds belong,
Through her prevailing prayer on high
In mercy hear thy peopleâ€™s cry.
