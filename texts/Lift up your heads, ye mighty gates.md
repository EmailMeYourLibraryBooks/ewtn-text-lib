# Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 485

Lift up your heads, ye mighty gates;
Behold the King of glory waits!
The King of kings is drawing near;
The Savior of the world is here.

O blest the land, the city blest,
Where Christ the ruler is confessed!
O happy hearts and happy homes
To whom this King of triumph comes!

Fling wide the portals of your heart; 
Make it a temple, set apart
from earthly use for heavenâ€™s employ,
Adorned with prayer and love and joy.

So come, my Sovereign; enter in!
Let new and nobler life begin;
Thy Holy Spirit guide us on,
Until the glorious crown be won.
