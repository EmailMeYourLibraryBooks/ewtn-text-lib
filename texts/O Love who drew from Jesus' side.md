# Title: O Love, who drew from Jesus side

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 562

O Love who drew from Jesus’ side,
One body freed from Adam’s shame,
One Church sent forth to serve and guide,
One faith confirmed by gifts of flame;
When wordly schemes our hopes assail
Thy kingdom come, thy truth prevail.

Round Peter’s chair may all unite;
From blinded eyes the veil withdraw;
The minds of rulers set aright
Who bind your Church beneath their law;
Where faith grows dim and hearts are frail,
Thy kingdom come, thy truth prevail.

While Christians pray for unity,
Pour forth the light your saints have seen;
Dispel the dark of enmity:
Make known to all what love can mean,
Where brooding minds old wounds bewail,
Thy kingdom come, thy truth prevail.

Spoiled children, we, so blest with sight,
Redeemed by love surpassing all; 
Lest we who glory in your light
Share not our gift, heed not your call,
In Christian hearts that faint and fail,
Thy kingdom come, thy truth prevail.
