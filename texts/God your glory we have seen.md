God, your glory we have seen in your Christ,
full of grace, full of holy truth;
in him makes us live anew,
filled with his own love,
and the world shall see the fruits of your victory.

Christ our Lord is our Passover offered on high;
he broke the Bread: Amen! to ourselves we must die.

full of grace, full of holy truth;
in him makes us live anew,
filled with his own love,
and the world shall see the fruits of your victory.

Christ our Lord trod the grapes as he hung on the Tree;
he’s filled the cup: be joyful! He rose, so shall live.

God, your glory we have seen in your Christ,
full of grace, full of holy truth;

filled with his own love,
and the world shall see the fruits of your victory.

Christ our Lord built a kingdom, God’s Kingdom on the earth;
the cornerstone he hewed: to our work, Lord, give worth!

God, your glory we have seen in your Christ,
full of grace, full of holy truth;
in him makes us live anew,
filled with his own love,
and the world shall see the fruits of your victory.

Christ our Lord cast his word into man’s furrowed field:
The Sower sowed the seed and he waits for the yield.

full of grace, full of holy truth;

filled with his own love,
and the world shall see the fruits of your victory.
