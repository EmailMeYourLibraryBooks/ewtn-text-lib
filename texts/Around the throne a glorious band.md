# Around the throne a glorious band

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 335

Around the throne a glorious band,
The saints in countless numbers stand,
Of every tongue redeemed to God,
Arrayed in garments washed in blood.
Alleluia!

Through tribulation great they came;
They bore the Cross, despised the shame;
From all their labors now they rest
In God’s eternal glory blest.
Alleluia!

They see their Savior face to face
And sing the triumphs of his grace;
Each day and night they sing his praise,
To him the loud thanksgiving raise:
Alleluia!

“Worthy the Lamb, for sinners slain,
Through endless years to live and reign;
You have redeemed us by your blood,
And made us kings and priests to God.”
Alleluia!

O may we tread the sacred road
That saints and holy martyrs trod;
Wage to the end the glorious strife
And win, like them, a crown of life.
