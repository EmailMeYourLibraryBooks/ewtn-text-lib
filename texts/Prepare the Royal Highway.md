# Prepare the Royal Highway

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 26

Prepare the royal highway,
the King of kings is near;
let every hill and valley
a level road appear.
Then greet the king of glory
foretold in sacred story:
Hosanna to the Lord, 
For he fulfills God's Word!

God’s people, see him coming:
your own eternal king!
Palm branches strew before him;
spread garments; shout and sing.
God’s promise will not fail you;
no more shall doubt assail you:
Hosanna to the Lord, 
For he fulfills God's Word!

Then fling the gates wide open
to greet your promised king;
your king, yet every nation
its tribute too should bring.
All lands, bow down before him;
all voices, thus adore him:
Hosanna to the Lord, 
For he fulfills God's Word!

His is no earthly kingdom;
it comes from heaven above.
His rule is peace and freedom,
and justice, truth, and love.
So let your praise be sounding
for kindness so abounding:
Hosanna to the Lord, 
For he fulfills God's Word!
