# EWTN Choir Music Text Library

***

### Welcome to the EWTN Choir text library.
If you're not there already, check out the repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/EmailMeYourLibraryBooks/ewtn-text-lib).

This repository was created in part to provide easy access to lyrics to our Closed Captioning team. The library is fully searchable and is constantly being updated as we perform new music. Please feel free to browse our catalogâ€“if you find an error in a lyric, and if you are so inclined, please [add a new issue](https://github.com/EmailMeYourLibraryBooks/ewtn-text-lib/issues/new) so that I can address it. 

Thanks, and happy browsing!

-D.
