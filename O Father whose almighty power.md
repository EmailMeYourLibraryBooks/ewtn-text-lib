# O Father, whose almighty power

## Setting: Handel/Banks

O Father, whose almighty power
The heavens and earth,
The heavens and earth, and seasons adore!
The hearts of Judah, thy delight,
In one defensive band unite.

All praise unto our Mighty King, 
With glorious anthems let us sing;
All praise unto our Mighty King, 
With glorious anthems let us sing;
All praise unto our Mighty King, 
With glorious anthems let us sing;
All praise unto our Mighty King, 
With glorious anthems let us sing.
