# Pardoned through redeeming grace

***

## Setting: Thaxton

Pardoned through redeeming grace,
In your blessed Son revealed,
Worshiping before your face,
Lord, to you ourselves we yield.

This our sacrifice receive
Humbly offered through your Son;
Quicken us in him to live;
Lord, in us your will be done.

By the hallowed outward sign,
By the cleansing grace within,
Seal us with your own design;
Wash and keep us pure from sin.

Called to bear the Christian name,
May our vows and life accord,
And our every deed proclaim
“Holiness unto the Lord!”
