# O Lord, My God

## Setting: Harry Alexander Matthews

O Lord, my God, O Lord, my God,
hear Thou the prayer Thy servant prayeth,
have Thou respect unto his prayer,
have Thou respect unto his prayer.

Hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place
Hear Thou in heaven Thy dwelling place
and when Thou hearest,
and when Thou hearest,
and when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive,
and when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive.

O Lord, my God, O Lord, my God,
hear Thou the prayer Thy servant prayeth,
have Thou respect unto his prayer,
And when Thou hearest,
And when Thou hearest,
And when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive,
And when Thou hearest, Lord, forgive, forgive.
