# My house shall be an house of prayer

***

## Setting: Michael Thaxton

“My House shall be an House of Prayer,
For all that live, to worship there.”
Thus saith the Lord: how answer we?
“Thine House, our House of Prayer shall be.”

“Wherever I my Name record,
There will I meet Thee,” saith the Lord;
Thee in Thine House of Prayer we meet;
Now bless us from the Mercy seat.

Thus spake the Lord, “My Son, to Thee
Swear every tongue, bow every knee:”
Father, by us Thy will be done,
We bow the knee and “Kiss the Son.”

His throne and kingdom thus advance,
The world be his inheritance;
Then, for all people everywhere,
Thine Hose shall be an House of Prayer.
