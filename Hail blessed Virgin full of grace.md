# Hail, blessed Virgin, full of grace

***

## Setting: Collegeville Hymnal 314

Hail, blessed Virgin, full of grace, 
Splendor of all the human race,
We honor you for Christ your Son,
Who has for us redemption won.

Hail Star of ocean, shining bright, 
For the oppressed a guiding light,
We ask your aid to intercede
With God to help us in our need.

Hail Queen of heaven, high above,
Grant that we all may share your love,
And pray that heaven we may see,
To live with God eternally.
