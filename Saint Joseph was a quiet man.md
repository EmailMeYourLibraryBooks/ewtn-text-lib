# Saint Joseph was a quiet man

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Saint Joseph was a quiet man
who made things out of wood.
He worked with love to guide his hand
And what he made was good.
He lived with God, a little boy,
From whom all things have come;
He worked for him in peace and joy,
Who made the stars and sun.

A carpenter to guard the Son
who set the stars on high,
A carpenter made chairs for One
who made the earth and sky.
He lived with God, a little boy,
From whom all things have come;
He worked for him in peace and joy,
Who made the stars and sun.
