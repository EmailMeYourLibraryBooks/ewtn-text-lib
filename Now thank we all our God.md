# Now thank we all our God

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 607

Now thank we all our God
With heart, and hands, and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In whom his world rejoices;
Who, from our mother's arms
Hath blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.

O may this gracious God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us;
Preserve us in his grace,
And guide us in distress,
And free us from all sin,
Till heaven we possess.

All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son, and Spirit blest,
Who reigns in highest heaven,
Eternal, Triune God,
Whom earth and heav'n adore;
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be, evermore.
