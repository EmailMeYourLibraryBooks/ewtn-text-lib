# Hark, I hear the harps eternal

***

## Setting: Parker/Shaw

Hark, I hear the harps eternal
Ringing on the farther shore,
As I near those swollen waters, 
With their deep and solemn roar.

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lamb,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Glory to the great I AM.

And my soul though stained with sorrow,
Fading as the light of day,
Passes swiftly oâ€™er those waters
To the city far away.

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lamb,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Glory to the great I AM.

Souls have crossed before me, saintly,
To that land of perfect rest;
And I hear them singing faintly
In the mansions of the blest.

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lamb,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Glory to the great I AM.

Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, praise the Lamb,
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Glory to the great I AM.
