# From all thy saints in warfare

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal (Generic)

From all Thy saints in warfare, 
for all Thy saints at rest,
To Thee, O blessèd Jesus, 
all praises be addressed;
Thou, Lord, didst win the battle, 
that they might conquerors be;
Their crowns of living glory 
are lit with rays from Thee.

Apostles, prophets, martyrs,
And all the sacred throng
Who wear the spotless raiment,
Who raise the ceaseless song—
For these, passed on before us,
Savior, we thee adore,
And walking in their footsteps,
Would serve thee more and more.

Then praise we God the Father,
and praise we God the Son,
And God the Holy Spirit,
eternal Three in One;
Till all the ransomed number
fall down before the throne,
And honor, power, and glory,
ascribe to God alone.

From all Thy Saints in warfare,
For all Thy Saints at rest,
To Thee, O blessed Jesus,
All praises be address'd;
Thou, Lord, didst win the battle
That they might conquerors be;
Their crowns of living glory
Are lit with rays from Thee.

All praise for Thine Apostle, 
blest guide to Greek and Jew,
And him surnamed Thy brother; 
keep us Thy brethren true,
And grant us grace to know Thee, 
the Way, the Truth, the Life:
To wrestle with temptations 
till victors in the strife.

Then praise we God the Father, 
and praise we God the Son,
And God the Holy Spirit, 
eternal Three in One;
Till all the ransomed number 
fall down before the throne,
And honour, power, and glory 
ascribe to God alone.

for all Thy saints at rest,
To Thee, O blessèd Jesus, 
all praises be addressed;
Thou, Lord, didst win the battle, 
that they might conquerors be;
Their crowns of living glory 
are lit with rays from Thee.

Praise, Lord, for thine apostles 
Who sealed their faith today;
One love, one zeal impelled them 
To tread the sacred way.
May we with zeal as earnest 
The faith of Christ maintain 
And, bound in love as brethren,
 At length thy rest attain.

Then praise we God the Father,
and praise we God the Son,
And God the Holy Spirit,
eternal Three in One;
Till all the ransomed number
fall down before the throne,
And honor, power, and glory,
ascribe to God alone.

All praise for thine apostle,
The faithful, pure and true,
Whom underneath the fig tree
Thine eye all-seeing knew;
Like him may we be guileless
True Israelites indeed
That thine abiding presence
Our longing souls may feed.

Then praise we God the Father,
and praise we God the Son,
And God the Holy Spirit,
eternal Three in One;
Till all the ransomed number

And honor, power, and glory,
