# Whoever serves me

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Whoever serves me, let him follow me,
for where I am, my servant will be also.
My Father will honor the one who serves me,
My Father will honor the one who serves me.

Verily I say unto you,
Unless a kernel of wheat fall to the ground and dies,
it abideth alone;
but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit,
it brings forth much fruit.

Whoever serves me, let him follow me,
for where I am, my servant will be also.
My Father will honor the one who serves me,
My Father will honor the one who serves me.

Anyone who loves this life will lose it,
while those who hate their life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
I am come as a light into the world,
that whosever liveth in me should not abide in darkness.

Whoever serves me, let him follow me,
for where I am, my servant will be also.
My Father will honor the one who serves me,
My Father will honor the one who serves me.
