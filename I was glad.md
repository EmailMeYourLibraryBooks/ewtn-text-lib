# I was glad

I was glad, I was glad,
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go, let us go,
Let us go into the house of the Lord!

Jerusalem: with what great joy
I heard them say, “Let us go there!”
And now at last we take our stand
Within her gates to make our prayer.

I was glad, I was glad,
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go, let us go,
Let us go into the house of the Lord!

Jerusalem: a city built
To be a place of unity;
The tribes to up, the tribes of God,
To praise God’s Name eternally.

I was glad, I was glad,
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go, let us go,
Let us go into the house of the Lord!

Jerusalem: pray for her peace:
“May all who love you fine success;
to all within your walls be peace,
and in your towers be quietness.”

I was glad, I was glad,
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go, let us go,
Let us go into the house of the Lord!

Jerusalem: for brethren’s sake
My prayers for you will never cease;
Because God’s house is standing here,
I will pray forever for your peace.

I was glad, I was glad,
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go, let us go,
Let us go into the house of the Lord!

I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.

Our feet shall stand in thy gates, O Jerusalem;
Our feet shall stand in thy gates, O Jerusalem;
Jerusalem is built, is built as a city
that is at unity, that is at unity with itself.

I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.

O pray for the peace of Jerusalem;
they shall prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls,
and plenteousness within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions’ sakes
I will wish thee prosperity.
Ye because of the house of the Lord,
I will seek to do thee good.

I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.
I was glad when they said unto me:
Let us go into the house of the Lord.
