# Where charity and love prevail

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Roby)

Where charity and love prevail,
there God is ever found;
Brought here together by Christ’s love,
by love are we thus bound.

With grateful joy and holy fear
his charity we learn;
Let us with heart and mind and soul
now love him in return.

Forgive we now each other’s faults
as we our faults confess;
And let us love each other well
in Christian holiness.

Let strife among us be unknown,
let all contention cease;
Be his the glory that we seel,
be ours his holy peace.

Let us recall that in our midst
dwells God's begotten Son;
As members of his body joined, 
we are in him made one.

No race nor creed can love exclude 
if honored be God's name;
Our brotherhood embraces all 
whose Father is the same.
