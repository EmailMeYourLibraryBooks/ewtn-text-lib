# O Jesus, I have promised

***

## Setting: Banks (NYLAND)

O Jesus, I have promised
to serve you to the end;
be now for ever near me,
my Master and my Friend:
I shall not fear the battle
if you are by my side,
nor wander from the pathway
if you will be my guide.

O let me feel you near me:
the world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
the tempting sounds I hear;
my foes are ever near me,
around me and within;
but, Jesus, draw still nearer,
and shield my soul from sin.

O let me hear you speaking
in accents clear and still
above the storms of passion,
the murmurs of self-will;
O speak to reassure me,
to hasten or control;
O speak, and make me listen,
O guardian of my soul.

O Jesus, you you promised
to all who follow you,
that where you are in glory
there shall your servant be;
and, Jesus, I have promised
to serve you to the end:
O give me grace to follow,
my Savior and my Friend.
