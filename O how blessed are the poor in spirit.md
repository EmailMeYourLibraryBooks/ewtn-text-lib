O how blessed are the poor in spirit,
Theirs is the Kingdom of heaven.
And how blessed are the sad and mournful,
They’ll be consoled by God.

Blessed and happy we shall be.
Listen to the Master’s word!
Soon the Kingdom’s coming, watch and see:
The Kingdom of the Lord!

O how blessed are the meed and humble,
They will inherit the earth.
And how blessed those who hunger for goodness,
They all will feast with God.

Blessed and happy we shall be.
Listen to the Master’s word!
Soon the Kingdom’s coming, watch and see:
The Kingdom of the Lord!

O how blessed are the mercy givers,
Such mercy will receive.
And how blessed are the pure in heart,
They surely will see God.

Blessed and happy we shall be.
Listen to the Master’s word!
Soon the Kingdom’s coming, watch and see:
The Kingdom of the Lord!

O how blessed are the true peace makers,
They will be known as God’s Children.
And how blessed those who suffer for justice,
They will honored by God.

Blessed and happy we shall be.
Listen to the Master’s word!
Soon the Kingdom’s coming, watch and see:
The Kingdom of the Lord!
