# Angels and Ministers

***

## Setting: Banks (SLANE)

Angels and ministers, spirits of grace,
Friends of the children, beholding God’s face,
Moving like thought to us through the beyond,
Molded in beauty, and free from oud bond!
 
Messengers clad in the swiftness of light,
Subtle as flame, and creative in might,
Helmed with the truth and with charity shod,
Wilding the wind of the purpose of God!
 
Earth’s myriad creatures live after their kind,
Dumb, in the life of the body confined;
You are pure spirit, but we here below,
Linked in both orders, are tossed to and fro.
 
We too shall join you as comrades in grace,
Here but a little below you in place;
Then, when we climb from our lowness in worth,
We too shall herald good will upon earth.
