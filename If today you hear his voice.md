# If today you hear his voice

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

Come, let us ring out our joy to the Lord; 
jail the rock who saves us. 
Let us come into his presence, giving thanks; 
let us hail him with a song of praise.

If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

O come; let us bow and bend low. 
Let us kneel before the God who made us, 
for he is our God and we the people who belong to his pasture, 
the flock that is led by his hand.

If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.

O that today you would listen to voice! 
“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, 
as on that day at Massah in the desert when your forbears put me to the test; 
when they tried me, though they saw my work.”

If today you hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
