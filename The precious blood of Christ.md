# The precious blood of Christ

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks (Sanguinem Christi)

The precious blood of Christ!
The Lamb of God once slain;
Doth cleanse the soul from all its guilt,
Removing every stain.
The blood, the precious blood,
Be this my only plea;
The blood, the precious blood,
The savior shed for me.

The precious blood of Christ!
Thru faith it justifies
The soul that feels its guilty load,
And loud for mercy cries.
The blood, the precious blood,
Be this my only plea;
The blood, the precious blood,
The savior shed for me.

The precious blood of Christ!
Its virtues neâ€™er can bless
An anxious sinner with its peace,
Till he his sins confess.
The blood, the precious blood,
Be this my only plea;
The blood, the precious blood,
The savior shed for me.
