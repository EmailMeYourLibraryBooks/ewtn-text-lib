# We walk by faith

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement, Hymn Sheet (Roby)

We walk by faith, and not by sight,
no gracious words we hear
from him who spoke as none e’er spoke,
but we believe him near.

We may not touch his hands and side,
nor follow where he trod;
but in his promise we rejoice
and cry, “My Lord and God!”

Help then, O Lord, our unbelief;
and may our faith abound
to call on you when you are near,
and seek where you are found.

For you, O resurrected Lord,
are found in means divine:
beneath the water and the Word,
beneath the bread and wine.

Lord, when our life of faith is done,
in realms of clearer light
we may behold you as you are
with full and endless sight.
