# All ye who long toward Christ to fly

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

All ye who long toward Christ to fly,
Lift up your eyes to him on high:
There mortal gaze hath strength to see
The token of his majesty.

This is the King whose sov’reign sway
The Gentiles and the Jews obey,
To Abr’am promised and decreed
To rule his num’rous faithful seed.

The Prophets his dread name unfold
And sign the truth by them foretold;
Him God the Father from his throne
Commands the world to hear and own.

To thee, O Lord, we glory pay,
Who hast revealed thyself today:
All glory through eternity
To Father and the Spirit be.
