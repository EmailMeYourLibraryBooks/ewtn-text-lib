# O Word of God, incarnate

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 231

O Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky:
We praise you for the radiance
That from the hallowed page,
A lantern to our footsteps,
Shines on from age to age.

The Church from you, dear Master,
Received the gift divine;
And still that light is lifted
O'er all the earth to shine.
It is the chart and compass
That, all life's voyage through,
Mid mists and rocks and quicksands
Still guides, O Christ, to you.

Oh, make your Church, dear Savior,
A lamp of burnished gold
To bear before the nations
Your true light, as of old;
Oh, teach your wand'ring pilgrims
By this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended,
They see you face to face.
