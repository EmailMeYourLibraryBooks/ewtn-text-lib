# I am wonderfully made

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

O Lord, you search me and you know me,
My nature you understand;
Whenever I sit, whenever I rise.
You know the thoughts and deeds I have planned.

For I am wonderfully made;
You knitted me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise your marvelous ways, 
and the seed of grace you’ve sewn in me will bloom.

O Where can I depart from your Spirit?
O where could I hide my face?
If to the heavens I ascend,
then you do attend,
Or if I sink down low, You know the place.

For I am wonderfully made;
You knitted me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise your marvelous ways, 
and the seed of grace you’ve sewn in me will bloom.

Search me, O God, search me deeply,
And know my heart fully, I pray.
See if there be a wrong way in me,
And lead me in your endless Way.

For I am wonderfully made;
You knitted me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise your marvelous ways, 
and the seed of grace you’ve sewn in me will bloom.

For I am wonderfully made;
You knitted me in my mother’s womb.
I will praise your marvelous ways, 
and the seed of grace you’ve sewn in me will bloom,
the seed of grace you’ve sewn in me will bloom.
