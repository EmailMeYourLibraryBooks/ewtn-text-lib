# Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 516

Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all,
How can I love thee as I ought?
And how revere this wondrous gift,
So far surpassing hope or thought?
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

Had I but Mary's sinless heart
To love thee with, my dearest King,
Oh, with what bursts of fervant praise
Thy goodness, Jesus, would I sing.
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

Thy Body, Soul, and Godhead, all,
O mystery of love divine.
I cannot compass all I have,
For all thou hast and art are mine.
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

Sound then, his praises highter still,
And come, ye angels, to our aid;
For this is God, the very God
Who has both men and angels made!
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

Thou art with us, O dearest Lord,
Ever our guest and food to be;
Strengthen the faith of loving hearts
Who put their hope and trust in thee.
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.

Jesus, dear pastor of the flock,
We crowd in love about thy feet;
Our voices yearn to praise thee, Lord,
And joyfully thy presence greet.
Sweet Sacrament, we thee adore;
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
Oh, make us love thee more and more.
