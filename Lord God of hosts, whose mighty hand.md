# Lord God of hosts, whose mighty hand

## Setting: Hymn sheet (NEUMARK)

Lord God of hosts, whose mighty hand
Dominion holds on sea and land,
In peace and war thy will we see,
Shaping the larger liberty;
Nations may rise and nations fall,
Thy changeless purpose rules them all.

For those who weak and broken lie
In weariness and agony,
Great Healer, to their beds of pain
Come, touch and make them whole again.
O hear a people’s prayers, and bless
Thy servants in their hour of stress!

For those to whom the call shall come,
We pray thy tender welcome home;
The toil the bitterness, all past,
We trust them to thy love at last.
O hear a people’s prayers for all 
Who, nobly striving, nobly fall!
