# Prayer of Padre Pio

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

I trust in your power and grace that sustain and restore me.

Loving Father, touch me now with your healing hands,

for I believe that your will is for me to be well in mind, body, soul and spirit.

Cover me with the most precious blood of your Son, our Lord,

Jesus Christ from the top of my head to the soles of my feet.
