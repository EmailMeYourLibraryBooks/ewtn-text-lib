# Come unto me 

***

# Setting: Handel, arr. Banks (Messiah)

Come unto me, all you that labor;
Come unto me all you that are weary and burdened,
and I will give you rest.

Come unto me, all you that labor;
Come unto me all you that are weary and burdened,
and I will give you rest.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am gentle and humble in heart,
and you will find rest,
and you will find rest,
rest for your soul.

Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
for I am gentle and humble in heart,
and you will find rest,
and you will find rest,
rest for your soul.
