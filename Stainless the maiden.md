# Stainless the maiden

***

## Setting: Hymn Sheet (Thaxton)

Stainless the maiden
whom he chose for mother;
Nine months she waited,
bearing Christ our brother;
Think of her gladness
when at last shee saw him
God in a manger,
Bethlehem a heaven!
 
Lantern in darkness,
when the sick are sighing,
Threshhold of brightness,
comfort for the dying,
High shee is holding
for a world adoring,
Hope of the nations,
Jesus Christ our brother.
 
Jesus has conquered;
to his side he raised her;
Queen of the angels,
every saint has praised her.
Yet, in her splendor,
Mary goes on drawing
Sinners and exiles
to their promised glory.
 
Sons, come, and daughters,
through the ages singing,
Praising the Virgin,
joys and sorrows bringing.
Clothed with the sunshine,
Sionâ€™s fairest flower,
Spouse of the spirit,
be to us a mother.
