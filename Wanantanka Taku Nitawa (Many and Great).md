# Wanantanka Taku Nitawa (Many and Great)

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

Wakantanka taku nitawa tankaya qa ota;
Mahpiya kin eyahnake cha,
Maka kin he duowancha.
Mniowancha śbeya wanke chin,
hena oyakihi.
Woehaku nitawa kin he
minaji kin qu wo;
Mahpiya kin iwankam yati,
wicowaśte yuha nanka,
Wiconi kin he mayaqu nun,
owihanke wain.

Many and great, O God, are your works,
Maker of earth and sky;
Your hands have set the heavens with stars,
Your fingers spread the mountains and plains.
Lo, at your word, the waters were formed;
deep seas obey your voice
Grant unto us communion with you,
O star abiding One;
Come unto us and dwell with us;
with you are found the gifts of life.
Bless us with life that has no end,
eternal life with you.
