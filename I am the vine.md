I am the vine, you are the branches,
If you abide in me, I will abide in you,
And you will bear much fruit,
You will bear much fruit
And by this fruit is the Father glorified.
 
As the Father has loved me,
so have I also loved you,
Abide in my love, Abide in my love.
 
I am the vine, you are the branches,
If you abide in me, I will abide in you,
And you will bear much fruit,
You will bear much fruit
And by this fruit is the Father glorified.
 
A new commandment I give,
That you shall love one another
As I have loved you,
As I have loved you.
 
I am the vine, you are the branches,
If you abide in me, I will abide in you,
And you will bear much fruit,
You will bear much fruit
And by this fruit is the Father glorified.
 
Greater love has no one
than that they lay down their life,
their life for their friends,
their life or their friends.
 
I am the vine, you are the branches,
If you abide in me, I will abide in you,
And you will bear much fruit,
You will bear much fruit
And by this fruit is the Father glorified.
