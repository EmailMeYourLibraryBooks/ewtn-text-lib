# Dear angel, ever at my side

***

## Setting: Saint Gregory Hymnal 112

Dear Angel, ever at my side,
How loving Thou must be
To leave Thy home in heav’n to guide
A little child like me!

Thy beautiful and shining face
I see not, tho’ so near;
The sweetness of Thy soft, low voice
Too deaf am I to hear.

But when, dear Spirit, I kneel down,
Both morn and night to prayer,
Some thing there is within my heart,
Which tells me thou art there.

Oh! When I pray, thou prayest too,
Thy prayer is all for me;
But when I sleep, thou sleepest not,
But watchest patiently.

Then, for thy sake, dear Angel! Now
More humble will I be:
But I am weak, and when I fall,
O weary not of me.

Then love me, love me, Angel dear! 
And I will love thee more;
And help me when my soul is cast
Upon th’eternal shore.
