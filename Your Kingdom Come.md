# Your Kingdom Come

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Your kingdom come! O Father, hear our prayer;
Shine through the clouds that threaten ev'rywhere;
Light from above, our only life and joy,
Show us the hope that nothing can destroy;
Show us the hope that nothing can destroy.

Stumbling and blind, we strive to do your will,
Trusting the word you surely will fulfill,
That all are yours, however far they roam,
That love shall triumph, and your kingdom come;
That love shall triumph, and your kingdom come.

Come through the faith whereby the Church must live;
Come through the Word and Sacraments you give;
Come through your teaching, and your healing too;
Come through the work enlightened hearts can do;
Come through the work enlightened hearts can do.

Your kingdom come; come too, God's glorious Son!
Oh, may our task for you be nobly done!
Faithful let all your servants be, and true,
Until they bring all nations home to you;
Until they bring all nations home to you.
