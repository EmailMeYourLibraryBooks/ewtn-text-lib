# Christ is made the sure foundation

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 561

Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone
Chosen of the Lord, and precious,
Binding all the Church in one;
Holy Zion’s help forever, 
And her confidence alone.

To this temple, where we call thee,
Come, O Lord of hosts, today;
With thy wonted lovingkindness
Hear thy servants as they pray,
And thy fullest benediction
Shed in all it’s bright array.

Grant, we pray, to all thy people,
All the grace they ask to gain;
What they gain from thee, forever
With the blessed to retain,
And hereafter in thy glory
Evermore with thee to reign.
