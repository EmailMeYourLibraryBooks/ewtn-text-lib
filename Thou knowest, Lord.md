# Thou knowest, Lord

***

## Setting: Henry Purcell

Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;
shut not, shut not thy merciful ears unto our prayers;
but spare us, Lord, spare us, Lord most holy, 
O God, O God most mighty.

O holy and most merciful Saviour,
thou most worthy Judge eternal,
suffer us not, suffer us not, at our last hour,
for any pains of death, 
To fall, to fall from thee. Amen.
