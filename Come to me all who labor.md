# Come to me, all who labor

***

## Setting: Norbet/Evans

Come to me, all who labor
and are heavy-burdened,
and I shall give you rest.
Take up my yoke and learn from me,
for I am meek and humble of heart.
And you’ll find rest for your souls.
Yea, my yoke is easy
and my burden is light.

The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall never be in need.
Fresh and green are the meadows
where he gives me rest.
