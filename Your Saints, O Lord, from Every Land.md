# Your Saints, O Lord, from Every Land

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (John Chrysostom)

Your saints, O Lord, from every land
Have fought with love the fight; 
Through every age they kept the faith
Which serves all men as light.
Apostles, Martyrs, Prophets, too,
And shepherds of the flock:
They intercede with Mary’s prayers,
And those of Peter, ‘Rock.’

Like fire from holy beacon bright
His mouth has poured forth grace,
Enlighening the universe,
to save thehuman race.
His riches: his own poverty
Humility and love;
O teach us, holy Chrysostom
To pray Christ God above.

From heaven itself he did receive
the holy gift of grace
And from his lips we do receive 
A knowledge to embrace:
To worship God in persons three,
the Blessed Trinity,
O Father John, the Chrysostom,
Help us his face to see.
