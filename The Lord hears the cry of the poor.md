# The Lord hears the cry of the poor

***

## Setting: Michael Thaxton

Come to me, my children hear; 
Iâ€™ll teach you the Lord to fear.
To righteous ones his eye draws near,
His ears attend their cry.
The Lord hears the cry of the poor;
He hears the cry of the poor.
He hears their words and knows their shame,
Cures their troubles and heals their pain;
He embraces the broken and the lame,
The crushed in spirit feel his grace.
The Lord hears the cry of the poor;
He hears the cry of the poor.
Troubled may the righteous be;
The Lord delivers and sets free.
The Lord has sent us His decree:
He hears the cry of the poor.
The Lord hears the cry of the poor,
He hears the cry of the poor.

The Lord hears the cry of the poor,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
The Lord hears the cry of the poor, 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

I will bless the Lord at all times,
with praise ever in my mouth.
Let my soul glory in the Lord,
who will hear the cry of the poor.

The Lord hears the cry of the poor,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
The Lord hears the cry of the poor, 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

Let the lowly hear and be glad:
the Lord listens to their pleas;
and to broken hearts, God is near,
who will hear the cry of the poor.

The Lord hears the cry of the poor,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
The Lord hears the cry of the poor, 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.

Every wounded spirit God will save,
a ransom given for their lives;
The Lord will be a shelter from their fears,
and will hear the cry of the poor.

We proclaim your greatness, O God,
your praises ever in our mouth;
every face is brightened in your light,
for you hear the cry of the poor.

The Lord hears the cry of the poor,
Blessed be the Name of the Lord,
The Lord hears the cry of the poor, 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord.
