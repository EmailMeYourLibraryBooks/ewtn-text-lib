# There is a joy in serving Jesus

***

## Setting: Timothy Paul Banks

There is a joy in serving Jesus,
Yet as I journey on my way,
A joy that fills the heart with praises,
In every hour and every day.
There is a joy in serving Jesus,
A joy that throbs within my heart;
In every moment, in every hour,
A joy that never shall depart.

There is a joy in serving Jesus,
A joy that triumphs over pain;
It fills my soul with heavenâ€™s music,
Until I join the glad refrain.
There is a joy in serving Jesus,
A joy that throbs within my heart;
In every moment, in every hour,
A joy that never shall depart.

There is a joy in serving Jesus,
Yet as I walk alone with God;
It is the joy of Christ, my Savior,
Who the path of suffering trod.
There is a joy in serving Jesus,
A joy that throbs within my heart;
In every moment, in every hour,
A joy that never shall depart.

There is a joy in serving Jesus, 
A joy amid the darkest night,
For I have learned the wondrous secret,
And I am walking in the light.
There is a joy in serving Jesus,
A joy that throbs within my heart;
In every moment, in every hour,
A joy that never shall depart.
