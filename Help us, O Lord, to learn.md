# Help us, O Lord, to learn

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (ETHELWALD)

Help us, O Lord, to learn
the truths your word imparts:
to study that your laws may be
inscribed upon our hearts.

Help us, O Lord, to live
the faith which we proclaim,
that all our thoughts and words and deeds
may glorify your name.

Help us, O Lord, to teach
the beauty of your ways,
that yearning souls may find the Christ,
and live a life of praise.
