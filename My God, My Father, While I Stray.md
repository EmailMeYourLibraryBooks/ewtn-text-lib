# Title: My God, My Father, While I Stray

***

## Setting: The Lutheran Hymnal 418

My God and Father, while I stray
Far from my home in life's rough way,
Oh, teach me from my heart to say,
"Thy will be done."

Tho' dark my path and sad my lot,
Let me be still and murmur not,
Or breathe the prayer divinely taught,
"Thy will be done."

What tho' in lonely grief I sigh
For friends beloved, no longer nigh,
Submissive still would I reply--
"Thy will be done."

Tho' Thou hast called me to resign
What most I prized, it ne'er was mine;
I have but yielded what was Thine--
"Thy will be done."

Should grief or sickness waste away
My life in premature decay,
My Father, still I strive to say,
"Thy will be done."

Let but my fainting heart be blest
With Thy sweet Spirit for its Guest,
My God, to Thee I leave the rest--
"Thy will be done."

Renew my will from day to day;
Blend it with Thine and take away
All that now makes it hard to say,
"Thy will be done."

Then, when on earth I breathe no more,
The prayer, oft mixed with tears before,
I'll sing upon a happier shore,
"Thy will be done."
