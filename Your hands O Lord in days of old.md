# Your hands, O Lord, in days of old

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Roby)

Your hands, O Lord, in days of old
were strong to heal and save;
they triumphed over disease and death,
over darkness and the grave.

To you they went, the blind, the deaf,
the palsied, and the lame,
the leper set apart and shunned the sick
and those in shame.

And then your touch brought life and health,
gave hearing, strength and sight;
and youth renewed and health restored
praised you, the Lord of light:

And so, O Lord, be near to bless,
with all your healing power,
in troubled home, in crowded street,
in sorrowâ€™s saddest hour.

O be our gracious leader still
great Lord of life and death;
restore and strengthen, soothe and bless
with your almighty breath:

On hands that work and eyes that see
your healing wisdom pour,
that whole and sick, and weak and strong,
may praise you evermore.
