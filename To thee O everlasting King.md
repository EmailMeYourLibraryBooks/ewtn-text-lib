# To thee, O everlasting King

***

Setting: Saint Jean Brébeuf Hymnal 424

To thee, O everlasting King,
and maker of the worlds, we sing,
Who, with the Father ever one,
Wert ever His coequal Son.

Creator who, when earth began, To thine own image madest man,
Thou didst, in Adam, wed to clay
A spirit noble every way.

And when, with envy manywiled,
The devil had our race defiled,
Made Man, man’s likeness unto Thee
Thou didst restore with mastery.

Now born again from out the tomb,
As once, from Mary’s virgin womb,
Thou biddest us ourselves bestir
And quit with thee the sepulchre.

Eternal Shepherd, who dost purge
the flocki n thy baptismal surge:
This is the bath from which arise
Pure thoughts, and where sin buried lies.

Redeemer, on the Cross upraised,
Long owing to ourselves, be praised
That there thy blood salvation’s price
Paid lavishly in sacrifice.

May endless worlds the glories tell
Of Christ, who vanqished death and hell;
And one eternal praise repeat
The Father and the Paraclete.
