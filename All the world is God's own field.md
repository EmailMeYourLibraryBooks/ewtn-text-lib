# All the world is God's own field

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 570

All the world is Godâ€™s own field,
Fruit unto his praise to yield;
Wheat and tares together sown,
Unto joy or sorrow grown.

First the blade, and then the ear,
Then the full corn shall appear;
Grant, O harvest Lord, that we 
Wholesome grain and pure may be.

For the Lord our God shall come,
And shall take his harvest home;
From his field shall in that day
All offenses purge away;

Give his angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
In his garner evermore.
