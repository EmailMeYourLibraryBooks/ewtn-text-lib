# In ancient times God spoke to man

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement (AD CENAM AGNI PROVIDI)

In ancient times God spoke to man
Through prophets in divine command;
He gave the law and did foretell
The Savior through whom death was felled.

In shadows did God’s people dwell;
From darkness come, their lives to tell
Of his steadfastness e’er displaTyed,
His promise given to them ne’er to fade.

From exile and mean servitude,
In desert land with manna dewed,
God in his pity heard their plea,
and intervened and set them free.

Like Israel of old are we;
To him we call in our dire need;
But now he speaks through Christ his Son,
To us whose victory he won.

His prophets now by Spirit are, 
Apostles sent both near and far;
No darkness casts its gloomy pall,
But Love’s pure light illumines all.
