# Those who love, and those who labor

***

## Setting: Hymn sheet (Thaxton)

Those who love, and those who labor, 
Follow in the way of Christ;
Thus the first disciples found him, 
Thus the gift of love sufficed.
Jesus says to those who seek him, 
I will never pass you by;
Raise the stone and you shall find me;
Cleave the wood and there am I.

Where the many work together
They with Christ himself abide,
But the lonely workers also
Find him ever at their side.
Lo, the Prince of common welfare
Dwells within the market strife;
Lo, the bread of heaven is broken
In the sacrament of life.

Let the seeker never falter
Till the truth is found afar
With the wisdom of the ages
Underneath a giant star.
With the richest and the poorest,
of the sum of things possessed.
Like a child at first to wonder,
Like a king at last to rest.
