# When morning gilds the skies

***

## Setting: Adoremus Hymnal 614

When morning gilds the skies,
my heart, awaking, cries,
may Jesus Christ be praised!
When evening shadows fall,
this rings my curfew call,
may Jesus Christ be praised!

When mirth for music longs,
this is my song of songs:
may Jesus Christ be praised!
God's holy house of prayer
hath none that can compare
with: Jesus Christ be praised!

No lovelier antiphon
in all high heaven is known
than, Jesus Christ be praised!
There to the eternal Word
the eternal psalm is heard:
may Jesus Christ be praised!

Ye nations of mankind,
in this your concord find:
may Jesus Christ be praised!
Let all the earth around
ring joyous with the sound:
may Jesus Christ be praised!

Sing, suns and stars of space,
sing, ye that see his face,
sing, Jesus Christ be praised!
God's whole creation o'er,
both now and evermore
shall Jesus Christ be praised!
