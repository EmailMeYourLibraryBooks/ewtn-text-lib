# The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want

***

## Setting: Gordon Jacob

The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want.
He makes me down to lie
in pastures green; He leadeth me
the quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again;
and me to walk doth make
within the paths of righteousness,
e’en for his own name’s sake.

Yea, though I walk thro' death’s dark vale,
yet will I fear no ill;
for Thou art with me, and Thy rod
and staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnishéd
in presence of my foes;
my head Thou dost with oil anoint,
and my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
shall surely follow me:
and in God’s house forevermore
my dwelling place shall be.
