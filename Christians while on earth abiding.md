# Christians, while on earth abiding

***

## Setting: Lutheran Book of Worship 440

Christians, while on earth abiding,
Let us never cease to pray,
Firmly in the Lord confiding
As our parents in their day.
Be the childrenâ€™s voices raised
To the God their parents praised.
May his blessing, failing never, 
Rest upon his people ever.

Bless us, Father, and protect us 
From all harm in all our ways;
Patiently, O Lord, direct us
Safely through these fleeting days.
Let your face upon us shine,
Fill us with your peace divine.
Praise the Father, Son, and Spirit!
Praise him, all who life inherit!
