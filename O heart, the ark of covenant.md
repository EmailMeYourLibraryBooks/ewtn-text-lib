# O heart, the Ark of Covenant

# Setting: A Treasury of Catholic Song 130

O Heart, the Ark of Covenant,
That nevermore a law shall hold
Of fear and bondage, as of old,
But laws that peace and pardon grant:

O veil and temple, holy grail
Of Godâ€™s New Testament of love:
O Veil, O Temple, far above
The temple old, the riven veil.

O tender Heart, all wounded thus
That mortal eyes might find in Thee
A mirror of that charity
Unseen, but wounded still for us.

O symbol, speaking to our eyes
The altared Love, where He our Priest
Hath spread for us a twofold feast,
Bloody and bloodless Sacrifice.

Who would not love that loving Breast?
What ransomed soul can utter Nay
Nor choose to make that Heart for ay
The tabernacle of his rest?
