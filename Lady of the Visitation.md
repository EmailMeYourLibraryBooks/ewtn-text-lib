# Lady of the Visitation

***

## Setting: EWTN Hymn Supplement

Lady of the Visitation,
Daughter of a royal name,
Where so quickly are you running,
Glowing with the Spirit’s flame?

Christ it is you bear within you;
Love it is that leads you on
To attend your holy cousin
At the birth of John, her son.

See, Elizabeth in greeting
Comes to meet you with the word;
“Blest art thou among all women,”
Words as woman never heard.

“Blessed fruit of thy womb holy,”
So your cousin claims her Lord,
Him who lies within your body,
King Immortal, Christ adored.

Honor, glory, praise and power
Be to you the Virgin’s Son,
With the Father and the Spirit,
While eternal ages run.
